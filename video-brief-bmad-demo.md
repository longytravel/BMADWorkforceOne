# Video Production Brief: BMad Method AI Agent Demo

**Target Audience:** Director overseeing Platform Development Teams
**Duration:** 10-12 minutes (5-6 min each part)
**Objective:** Show how BMad AI agents enable domain experts to produce the same planning artifacts as Platform teams, with massive efficiency gains.

---

## The Core Message

**"Same method your teams use. Same rigor. Same deliverables. But now any domain expert can do it."**

Your Platform teams follow BMad Method with human specialists (SM, QA, Analyst, Architect, Dev, PM). BMad AI agents are those same specialists, orchestrated and context-aware, accessible to anyone who understands the business problem.

## Key Differentiators (Why This Isn't Just "ChatGPT")

1. **Orchestrated Specialist Agents** - Coordinated PM, Analyst, Architect, QA, Dev agents
2. **Context Management** - Agents share project context and reference previous decisions
3. **Connected Workflow** - Agent handoffs mirror real team workflows
4. **Sophisticated Elicitation** - Advanced techniques (Personas, Journey Maps, Lotus Blossom, SCAMPER)
5. **Quality Gates** - Built-in validation and review cycles

## PART 1: The BMad Process (5-6 minutes)

### Opening (30 sec)
"I'm a WFM expert, not a coder. Using BMad AI agents, I completed comprehensive planning for a WFM system. Same process your Platform teams use. Watch how."

### Process Parity (90 sec)
**Visual: Side-by-side workflow comparison**
- Platform Team: PM → Analyst → Architect → Dev → QA
- BMad Agents: PM agent → Analyst agent → Architect agent → Dev agent → QA agent
- **Message:** "Same methodology. This scales it, doesn't replace it."

### The Power: Elicitation & Orchestration (3 min)
**THIS IS THE WOW SECTION**

Show:
- **Analyst Agent capabilities:**
  - Personas using Jobs-to-be-Done
  - User Journey Mapping
  - Lotus Blossom brainstorming
  - SCAMPER innovation techniques
- **Context awareness:** Architect references requirements; QA validates against architecture
- **Agent transformation:** Orchestrator → Specialist → back to Orchestrator

**Message:** "Not basic prompts. Sophisticated discovery techniques that take analysts years to master."

### Business Value (60 sec)
- Domain experts empowered with full planning capabilities
- Platform teams focus on execution
- Iteration cycles: weeks → hours
- **NOT replacement** - this is **scaling expertise**

---

## PART 2: The Artifacts (5-6 minutes)

### Opening (20 sec)
"Here's what it produced. Compare to your Platform team outputs—same standard, same completeness."

### Showcase Key Documents:

**PRD** (90 sec)
- Vision, personas (from elicitation), user stories, epics, success metrics
- Show depth and traceability

**Architecture** (90 sec)
- System design, tech stack (with justifications), data models, integrations
- "Agent made technology choices with rationale—not templates"

**Stories & QA Strategy** (90 sec)
- Story breakdown with acceptance criteria
- Test coverage and quality gates
- "Ready for dev teams to execute"

**Supporting Analysis** (60 sec)
- Journey maps, process flows, decision logs
- "The thinking that shows WHY decisions were made"

### Closing (30 sec)
"Complete planning package for a WFM system. Created by a domain expert using BMad agents following your exact methodology. Same process. Same quality. Dramatically different timeline. Imagine what your experts across the business could achieve."

## Production Notes

### Tone
Professional, dynamic, director-level credible. Show real artifacts.

### Visual Priorities
**Part 1:** Elicitation capabilities, workflow parity, agent orchestration
**Part 2:** Document quality, side-by-side comparisons, depth of thinking

### Key Visuals
- Workflow comparison diagram (Platform vs. Agents)
- Agent transformation screen recording
- Elicitation examples (Personas, Journey Maps, Lotus Blossom)
- Document highlights from actual WFM project artifacts

### Pacing
- Part 1: Dynamic, show process in action
- Part 2: Slower, let artifact quality speak
- Use "same method" as connective tissue throughout

---

## Reference Materials Provided

You'll receive markdown files containing:
- BMad Method documentation (agents, workflows, elicitation techniques)
- WFM Project artifacts (PRD in `docs/prd/`, Architecture in `docs/architecture/`, Stories in `docs/stories/`)

**Extract compelling examples** that show depth and sophistication. This isn't surface-level—it's comprehensive planning.

## Success Metrics

After watching, the Director should:
1. Understand BMad AI agents = same method their teams use
2. Recognize sophisticated orchestration, not simple prompting
3. Be impressed by elicitation capabilities
4. See artifact quality matches Platform team outputs
5. Envision domain experts using this approach
6. Want to explore BMad for their organization

**Bottom line:** Scaling expertise, not replacing teams. Domain experts contribute with rigor. Platform teams execute faster. Everyone wins.
