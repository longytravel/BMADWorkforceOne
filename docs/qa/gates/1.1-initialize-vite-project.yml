# Additional Context
review_notes: |
  This Vite project initialization is exemplary and establishes a rock-solid foundation
  for the WFM Intelligence Demo application.

  Key accomplishments:
  - Modern toolchain with versions exceeding all architecture requirements
  - React 19.1.1 (req: 18.2+), TypeScript 5.9.3 (req: 5.3+), Vite 7.1.7 (req: 5.0+)
  - TypeScript strict mode properly enabled in tsconfig.app.json with additional linting
  - Clean configuration files following industry best practices
  - Comprehensive .gitignore excluding all required files (node_modules, dist, .env*)
  - Zero security vulnerabilities in entire dependency tree
  - Path aliases configured for maintainable imports (@/*)
  - Foundation successfully supports Epic 1 story progression

  Project evolution evidence validates the initialization quality:
  - Tailwind CSS integration successful
  - Testing infrastructure (Vitest) added without issues
  - Component architecture established cleanly
  - Type definitions well-organized

  No refactoring required. No issues identified. Perfect initialization.
