# Additional Context
review_notes: |
  This README implementation is exemplary and significantly exceeds the story requirements.

  Key accomplishments:
  - Comprehensive coverage of all 6 acceptance criteria with substantial additional value
  - Accurate technical specifications verified against project files
  - Professional presentation with consistent formatting and appropriate visual elements
  - Effective risk mitigation through "Important Notes" section managing POC/demo expectations
  - Clear progressive disclosure from high-level overview to deep technical details
  - Realistic quick start process (<10 minutes) with accurate repository paths
  - Excellent production readiness guidance for future evolution

  The minor issues identified (DOC-001, DOC-002) are low-severity documentation improvements
  that can be addressed in future iterations without blocking story completion.

  No refactoring was required. All documentation file references were validated to exist.
  Live demo URL confirmed functional.
