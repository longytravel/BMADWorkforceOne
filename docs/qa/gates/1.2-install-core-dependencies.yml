# Additional Context
review_notes: |
  Exemplary dependency installation and configuration that establishes a modern,
  well-integrated development environment for the WFM Intelligence Demo.

  Key accomplishments:
  - Complete coverage of all architecture-specified dependencies
  - Tailwind CSS 4.1.14 with modern @import syntax (exceeds v3.4+ requirement)
  - Shadcn/ui properly initialized with TypeScript, CSS variables, theming
  - Zustand 5.0.8 + Immer 10.1.3 for type-safe immutable state management
  - All UI libraries installed: react-big-calendar, recharts, dnd-kit, lucide-react, zod
  - date-fns 4.1.0 (exceeds 3.0+ requirement) for date manipulation
  - Prettier 3.6.2 + ESLint configured with project standards
  - Path aliases (@/*) consistently configured across tsconfig, Vite, and Shadcn
  - No security vulnerabilities or deprecated packages

  Configuration file quality:
  - tailwind.config.js: Dark mode support, complete Shadcn theming, proper content paths
  - components.json: Proper Shadcn setup with TypeScript, CSS variables, path aliases
  - postcss.config.js: Modern @tailwindcss/postcss plugin with autoprefixer
  - .prettierrc: Project standards (2-space, single quotes, trailing commas, no semicolons)
  - src/stores/appStore.ts: Clean example demonstrating Zustand + Immer patterns
  - src/lib/utils.ts: cn() utility for Tailwind class merging (clsx + tailwind-merge)
  - src/styles/globals.css: Tailwind v4 @import, complete light/dark theme variables

  All dependencies support tree-shaking and modern bundling for optimal performance.

  No refactoring required. No issues identified. Perfect dependency setup.
