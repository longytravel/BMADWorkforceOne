**Friday Morning:** Conduct 1 interview
**Friday Afternoon:** Week 1 Synthesis

**Week 1 Synthesis Meeting (2 hours):**
- **Review 5 Interviews:**
  - What patterns emerged?
  - Pain validation score: How many (out of 5) confirmed attrition is top-3 pain point?
  - Solution validation score: How many (out of 5) said IOI/CvD would change their scheduling approach?
  - Pricing validation: What budget ranges did we hear?

- **Early Pivot Signals:**
  - If 0-1 out of 5 validate pain → PAUSE sprint, reassess problem
  - If 2-3 out of 5 validate pain → Continue but refine positioning
  - If 4-5 out of 5 validate pain → Strong signal, continue confidently

- **Adjust Week 2 Interview Guide:**
  - What questions should we add/remove based on Week 1 learnings?
  - What new hypotheses emerged that need testing?

**End of Week 1 Deliverable:** 5 interviews completed, synthesis document, adjusted interview guide for Week 2

- Document findings in shared doc

**Interview Distribution Goal:**
- 3 interviews: Current NICE/Verint/Calabrio customers (understand why they chose incumbent)
- 2 interviews: Aspect or legacy WFM customers (understand replacement mindset)

**Progressive Validation:**
- By Interview 7-8: Start testing pricing explicitly
  - "If a solution like this existed, what would you expect to pay per agent per month?"
  - "How does $25/agent/month sound? Too high? Too low?"

**End of Day 16 Deliverable:** Partnership 1-pager + pitch deck ready

---

### **Day 17-18 (Wednesday-Thursday): Outreach & First Contact**

**Wednesday: Multi-Channel Outreach**

**LinkedIn Outreach (Morning):**
- Identify 5-7 Five9 contacts:
  - VP of Partnerships / Alliances
  - Director of Technology Partnerships
  - Product Manager (WFM or Workforce Optimization)
  - Business Development (Partner Channel)

- Send personalized connection requests:
  ```
  Hi [Name],

  I see you lead partnerships at Five9. I'm building an intelligent WFM solution designed for cloud contact centers, and I think there's potential synergy with Five9's customer base.

  Would you be open to a brief conversation about partnership opportunities?
  ```

**Email Outreach (Afternoon):**
- Find corporate emails (use Hunter.io or LinkedIn Sales Navigator)
- Send partnership inquiry:
  ```
  Subject: Partnership Inquiry: Intelligent WFM for Five9 Customers

  Hi [Name],

  I'm reaching out to explore a potential technology partnership between [Your Company] and Five9.

  **The Opportunity:**
  Many Five9 customers need modern workforce management beyond native capabilities. We've built an intelligent WFM platform specifically for cloud contact centers (100-500 agents) that could become a recommended solution for your customer base.

  **Key Differentiators:**
  - Intelligent Opportunity Index (IOI) scoring for fair, transparent scheduling
  - Real-time Capacity vs. Demand (CvD) heatmaps for service level protection
  - Agent-centered UX that reduces attrition

  We're in early stages but have strong customer validation and are building our first telephony integration with Five9.

  Would you be open to a 20-minute call to discuss partnership potential?

  [Link to 1-pager]

  Best,
  [Your Name]
  [Contact Info]
  ```

**Warm Introduction Path (If Available):**
- Check your network for Five9 connections (LinkedIn 2nd-degree)
- Ask for warm intro: "I'm exploring partnerships with Five9—do you know anyone in their partnerships team?"

**Thursday: Follow-Up & Alternative Partners**

- **Follow up on LinkedIn/email** (don't be pushy, just persistent)
- **Backup Plan:** If Five9 non-responsive, explore alternatives:
  - Amazon Connect (AWS contact center)
  - Talkdesk (mid-market focus)
  - Dialpad (modern cloud telephony)

**End of Day 18 Deliverable:** Outreach completed to 5-7 contacts; responses tracked

---

### **Day 19-21 (Friday-Weekend): First Meeting or Continued Outreach**

**Best Case (Meeting Scheduled):**
- Conduct partnership exploratory call
- Follow partnership meeting script (see below)
- Assess receptiveness (Enthusiastic? Polite pass? Need more proof?)

**Realistic Case (No Response Yet):**
- Continue follow-ups (timing may be off—holidays, busy season)
- Attend Five9 webinar or event to network
- Pivot to alternative partner (Amazon Connect, Talkdesk)

**Worst Case (Clear "No"):**
- Understand objections: Too early stage? Competitive conflict? Not strategic priority?
- Adjust strategy: Build integration anyway? Find different partner? Self-distribution only?

**Partnership Validation Checkpoint:**
- **GO Signal:** Meeting scheduled OR warm interest expressed → Partnership viable
- **CAUTION Signal:** No response but not rejected → Keep as medium-term opportunity
- **STOP Signal:** Clear rejection or competitive conflict → Focus on direct sales, not partnership distribution

**End of Week 3 Deliverable:**
- Partnership meeting completed (best case) OR
- Clear partnership strategy for next 90 days (build integration anyway? alternative partners?)

---

## Week 4: Competitive Validation + Go/No-Go Decision (Days 22-30)

### **Day 22-24 (Monday-Wednesday): Competitor Product Trials**

**Objective:** Hands-on validation that competitors DON'T have IOI/CvD features (confirm differentiation gap)

**Day 22 (Monday): Calabrio Trial**
- Sign up for Calabrio demo/trial (use personal email, not company domain if you want stealth)
- Request demo from sales OR self-serve trial if available
- Evaluation checklist:
  - Do they have explainable scheduling intelligence? (IOI-like)
  - Do they visualize capacity vs. demand? (CvD heatmap-like)
  - How are agent notifications designed? (Administrative vs. respectful tone)
  - What's the mobile experience like?
  - Pricing intel if disclosed

**Day 23 (Tuesday): NICE CXone Trial**
- Same process as Calabrio
- NICE is enterprise-focused; may be harder to get trial without sales engagement
- If trial not available, watch demo videos + review documentation thoroughly

**Day 24 (Wednesday): Workforce.com or Legion Trial (Optional)**
- Evaluate retail-focused competitors
- Focus: How mature is their contact center offering? Any SLA/adherence features yet?

**Documentation:**
- Screenshot key features
- Take notes on UX/workflow
- Update competitive battlecards with hands-on intel
- **Critical Question:** Could they add IOI/CvD features in 6-12 months? (Assess velocity)

**End of Day 24 Deliverable:** Competitive trial report with feature gap validation

---

### **Day 25-26 (Thursday-Friday): Synthesis & Decision Prep**

**Thursday: Validation Scorecard Compilation**

**Create Final Scorecard Across All 3 Validation Areas:**

| Validation Area | Hypothesis | Result | Evidence | GO/NO-GO Signal |
|-----------------|-----------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **Customer Pain** | Agent attrition is top-3 pain for 70%+ of contact centers | X/10 confirmed | [Interview quotes] | GO if 7+, CAUTION if 4-6, STOP if <4 |
| **Solution Fit** | IOI + CvD would change scheduling approach for 50%+ | X/10 said "game-changer" or "very valuable" | [Interview quotes] | GO if 5+, CAUTION if 3-4, STOP if <3 |
| **Pricing Viability** | $20-40/agent/month is acceptable for 60%+ | X/10 said "reasonable" or "would consider" | [Budget data] | GO if 6+, CAUTION if 4-5, STOP if <4 |
| **Competitive Gap** | No competitor has IOI + CvD + agent experience combo | ✅ or ❌ | [Trial findings] | GO if ✅, CAUTION if partial, STOP if ❌ (already exists) |
| **Partnership Viability** | Five9 or alternative shows interest in 30 days | ✅ Meeting scheduled OR ⚠️ Warm interest OR ❌ Rejection | [Outreach results] | GO if ✅, CAUTION if ⚠️, STOP if ❌ AND no alternative |

**Scoring Logic:**
- **Strong GO (Proceed Confidently):** 4-5 GO signals, 0-1 STOP signals
- **Conditional GO (Proceed with Adjustments):** 3 GO signals, 1-2 CAUTION signals, 0 STOP signals
- **Pivot Required:** 2 GO signals, 2+ CAUTION signals OR any STOP signal in critical area (Customer Pain, Competitive Gap)
- **STOP (Do Not Proceed):** 2+ STOP signals OR Customer Pain validation fails (<4/10)

**Friday: Decision Meeting Preparation**
- Compile all artifacts:
  - Validation scorecard
  - Customer interview synthesis
  - Competitive trial report
  - Partnership status update
  - Revised positioning & pricing
- Create decision presentation (10-15 slides)

**End of Day 26 Deliverable:** Decision-ready package

---

### **Day 27-28 (Weekend): Decision Meeting & Planning**

**Saturday or Monday (Flexible Based on Team Availability):**

**Decision Meeting Agenda (3 hours):**

**Part 1: Validation Review (60 min)**
- Present validation scorecard
- Review customer interview highlights (play 2-3 key clips)
- Discuss competitive findings
- Partnership status update

**Part 2: Decision Framework (30 min)**
- **GO Decision → What Changes Based on Validation?**
  - Positioning adjustments (did we learn new language/framing?)
  - Feature scope changes (MVP priorities shifted?)
  - Pricing finalization (land on specific number)
  - Partnership strategy (Five9 primary? Self-distribution backup?)

- **NO-GO Decision → Why? What Would Need to Change?**
  - Is it the market (contact centers don't care about attrition)?
  - Is it the solution (IOI isn't compelling enough)?
  - Is it the timing (competitive threats already closed gap)?
  - Is it us (lack of domain expertise/credibility)?

**Part 3: Next Steps (90 min if GO)**

**IF GO: Immediate Actions (Next 7 Days)**
1. Finalize product spec for MVP (based on validated feature priorities)
2. Kick off technical architecture planning
3. Hire/contract first designer (CvD heatmap visual is critical differentiator)
4. Continue Five9 partnership conversations
5. Build landing page + waitlist (start building brand presence)

**IF GO: 90-Day Roadmap**
- Month 1: Technical architecture + design sprints
- Month 2-3: MVP development (IOI v1 + CvD heatmap + agent notifications)
- Month 4: Alpha testing with 2-3 friendly customers
- Month 5-6: Beta launch + first 10 paying customers

**IF NO-GO: Pivot Options**
- Pivot 1: Different market (customer success teams instead of contact centers?)
- Pivot 2: Different solution (focus on compliance/fairness only? retention analytics only?)
- Pivot 3: Different approach (consulting/services instead of software?)
- Pivot 4: Shut down (pursue other opportunities)

**Part 4: Commitment**
- Document decision in writing
- If GO: Who commits to what? (founder time, capital investment, team hires)
- If NO-GO: What's the timeline for pivot or shutdown?

**End of Day 28 Deliverable:** GO/NO-GO decision documented with signed commitment

---

### **Day 29-30: Launch Immediate Next Steps (If GO)**

**Monday:**

- Create 90-day roadmap with milestones

**End of Sprint Deliverable:**
- Sprint retrospective document
- Validated strategy (if GO) or pivot plan (if NO-GO)
- 90-day execution plan

---

## Validation Framework: Key Hypotheses to Test

### **Hypothesis 1: Agent Attrition Pain**
**Statement:** Agent attrition (30-50% annually) is a top-3 pain point for contact center operations leaders, and unfair/unpredictable scheduling is cited as a top-5 reason agents quit.

**How to Validate:**
- Interview question: "What are your top 3 operational challenges right now?"
- Interview question: "What reasons do agents give when they resign?" (Listen for scheduling mentions)
- Interview question: "If you could reduce attrition by 15-20%, what would that be worth to your organization?"

**Success Criteria:** 7/10 interviews mention attrition as top-3 pain AND 5/10 mention scheduling as attrition driver

---

### **Hypothesis 2: IOI Scoring Resonates**
**Statement:** Showing agents an explainable "Intelligent Opportunity Index" score (WHY they were selected) will reduce perceived unfairness and increase buy-in for schedule changes.

**How to Validate:**
- Show mockup or describe concept: "What if your agents saw a 0-100 score explaining WHY they're the best fit for this shift—combining availability, skills, fairness, and impact?"
- Watch their reaction (excited? confused? skeptical?)
- Follow-up: "Would this change how your agents perceive scheduling decisions?"

**Success Criteria:** 5/10 say "This would be game-changing" or "Our agents would love this"

---

### **Hypothesis 3: CvD Heatmap Visual Resonates**
**Statement:** WFM planners need visual, real-time visibility into where capacity gaps threaten service levels (CvD heatmap), rather than hunting through spreadsheet reports.

**How to Validate:**
- Ask: "How do you currently identify coverage gaps that might cause service level breaches?"
- Describe CvD heatmap: "Imagine a visual heatmap showing red/yellow/green for every 15-min interval across the week—red = SLA risk, green = sufficient capacity."
- Ask: "Would this change how you manage intraday capacity?"

**Success Criteria:** 6/10 say "We need this" or "This would save hours of work"

---

### **Hypothesis 4: Pricing Acceptance**
**Statement:** Mid-market contact centers (100-500 agents) can afford $20-40/agent/month for modern WFM, especially if it reduces attrition and improves SLA performance.

**How to Validate:**
- Ask: "What's your current WFM budget per agent per month?" (baseline)
- Ask: "If a solution reduced attrition 15-20% and improved SLA performance, what would you pay per agent per month?"
- Test pricing: "How does $30/agent/month sound for a modern, intelligent WFM platform?"

**Success Criteria:** 6/10 say $20-40 range is "reasonable" or "we'd consider it"

---

### **Hypothesis 5: Competitive Differentiation**
**Statement:** No current WFM vendor (NICE, Verint, Calabrio, Workforce.com, Legion) offers explainable IOI scoring + CvD heatmap visualization + agent-centered notifications as integrated features.

**How to Validate:**
- Hands-on competitor trials (Calabrio, NICE CXone)
- Review product documentation, demo videos, release notes
- Ask interview subjects: "Has your current WFM vendor shown you features like IOI or CvD heatmaps?"

**Success Criteria:** Competitive trials confirm NO competitor has this feature combination

## Appendix: Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1: Can't Recruit 10 Interview Participants**
- Mitigation: Start outreach Day 1; use paid platforms (UserInterviews.com); offer $150 instead of $100

**Risk 2: Interview Feedback Is Lukewarm (Not Clear GO/NO-GO)**
- Mitigation: Increase sample size to 15-20 interviews; segment by persona (maybe Operations VPs don't care but WFM Planners do?)

**Risk 3: Five9 Doesn't Respond**
- Mitigation: Have backup partners ready (Amazon Connect, Talkdesk); build integration anyway for demo purposes

**Risk 4: Competitive Gap Doesn't Exist (Competitor Already Has IOI-Like Features)**
- Mitigation: Immediate STOP—don't build commodity feature; explore different differentiation (compliance? retention analytics?)

**Risk 5: Pricing Too High (Budget Objections)**
- Mitigation: Test freemium model; explore outcome-based pricing; reduce scope to lower cost
