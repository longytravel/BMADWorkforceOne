## Interview Script

### **Opening (5 minutes)**

**Start Recording:**
> "Hi [Name], thanks so much for joining today. Before we start, is it okay if I record this conversation? It's just for my notes—nothing will be shared publicly or used for sales."

**Set Context:**
> "I'm researching workforce management challenges in contact centers, specifically how scheduling decisions impact agent retention and operational performance. There's no sales pitch here—I'm just genuinely trying to understand your world.
>
> I've got about 30 minutes of questions. Feel free to be brutally honest—that's the most helpful feedback I can get.
>
> Sound good?"

### **Section 1: Background & Context (5 minutes)**

**Goal:** Understand their role, contact center size, and current WFM setup.

**Q1: Tell me about your role.**
- *Probe:* What are you responsible for day-to-day?
- *Probe:* Who do you report to? Who reports to you?

**Q2: Tell me about your contact center.**
- *Probe:* How many agents? How many sites?
- *Probe:* What channels? (voice, chat, email, etc.)
- *Probe:* Inbound vs. outbound? Industries served?

**Q3: Walk me through your workforce management setup.**
- *Probe:* What WFM tools do you use today? (NICE, Verint, Calabrio, spreadsheets?)
- *Probe:* How long have you used it?
- *Probe:* Who manages WFM? (Dedicated team? Operations managers? Outsourced?)

*[Capture verbatim: Current WFM tool, team size, years in use]*

---

### **Section 2: Pain Points & Challenges (10 minutes)**

**Goal:** Validate that agent attrition and scheduling fairness are top-3 pain points.

**Q4: What are your top 3 operational challenges right now?**
- *Let them talk. Don't lead with "attrition" or "scheduling."*
- *Probe:* Why is [challenge X] such a big deal? What's the impact?

*[Note: Did they mention attrition unprompted? If yes → strong signal]*

**Q5: Let's talk about agent turnover. What's your annual attrition rate?**
- *Probe:* Is that voluntary or involuntary?
- *Probe:* How does that compare to your goals or industry benchmarks?

**Q6: When agents leave, what reasons do they give?**
- *Probe:* Pay? Work-life balance? Management? Schedule unpredictability?
- *Let them list 3-5 reasons naturally.*

*[Note: Did they mention scheduling/fairness/flexibility? If yes → strong signal]*

**Q7: If you could wave a magic wand and reduce attrition by 15-20%, what would that be worth to your organization?**
- *Probe:* Cost savings? (recruitment, training)
- *Probe:* Operational benefits? (more experienced agents, better customer outcomes)
- *Probe:* Is this a priority for leadership? (CFO, COO care about this?)

*[Note: If they quantify value ($X saved, Y% service improvement) → strong signal for ROI-based selling]*

---

### **Section 3: Current WFM Experience (10 minutes)**

**Goal:** Understand pain points with existing WFM tools and scheduling workflows.

**Q8: Walk me through what happens when you need to change an agent's schedule last-minute.**
- *Probe:* How do you decide which agent to ask?
- *Probe:* How do you communicate the request to the agent?
- *Probe:* How do agents typically react? (Accept willingly? Push back? Resentment?)

*[Note: Listen for manual process, gut feel, "we just pick whoever's available," agent frustration]*

**Q9: How do your agents feel about scheduling decisions?**
- *Probe:* Do they trust that schedules are fair?
- *Probe:* Do they understand WHY they were selected for changes?
- *Probe:* Have you ever had complaints about favoritism or unfairness?

*[Note: If they say "trust is an issue" or "lots of complaints" → pain validated]*

**Q10: What do you like about your current WFM tool? What frustrates you?**
- *Probe (Likes):* What would you hate to lose if you switched?
- *Probe (Frustrations):* What takes way too long? What's confusing? What's missing?

*[Note: Capture verbatim frustrations—these become our attack points for competitive positioning]*

---

### **Section 4: Solution Validation (IOI + CvD Concepts) (10 minutes)**

**Goal:** Test if IOI scoring and CvD heatmap concepts resonate as valuable/game-changing.

**Setup:**
> "I'm going to describe a couple of concepts and get your reaction. These are ideas I'm exploring—not products I'm selling today. Just tell me honestly if they'd be useful or not."

---

#### **Concept 1: Intelligent Opportunity Index (IOI) Scoring**

**Describe:**
> "Imagine your WFM system gave you a score from 0-100 for every agent when you need to fill a shift or change a schedule. The score combines:
> - **Availability** (are they free? conflicts?)
> - **Skills & Performance** (can they handle this work? are they high-performing?)
> - **Service Impact** (does selecting them protect or risk service levels?)
> - **Fairness** (have they been asked a lot recently? historical burden)
> - **Compliance** (breaks, labor laws, overtime rules)
>
> The system ranks agents by IOI score and recommends the top 3-5. You still make the final call, but you see exactly WHY each agent scored high or low—full transparency."

**Q11: What's your reaction to that concept?**
- *Probe:* Would this change how you make scheduling decisions?
- *Probe:* Would you trust the score? What would make you trust it more or less?
- *Probe:* On a scale of 1-10, how valuable is this? (1 = useless, 10 = game-changer)

**Q12: How do you think your agents would react to seeing their own IOI score?**
- *Probe:* "You scored 85/100 because you're available, skilled, and haven't been asked recently."
- *Probe:* Would that increase buy-in? Reduce complaints about unfairness?

*[Success Signal: Score 7+ on value scale AND "agents would appreciate transparency"]*

---

#### **Concept 2: Capacity vs. Demand (CvD) Heatmap**

**Describe:**
> "Imagine opening your WFM dashboard and seeing a heatmap—a visual grid showing every 15-minute interval for the next week. Each cell is color-coded:
> - **Green:** Sufficient capacity (SLA safe)
> - **Yellow:** Tight capacity (watch closely)
> - **Red:** Capacity gap (SLA at risk)
>
> You can instantly see WHERE service level problems will occur without digging through reports. You click a red cell and it shows: 'Need 2 more agents with skills X, Y at 2pm Tuesday.'"

**Q13: What's your reaction to that concept?**
- *Probe:* How do you currently identify coverage gaps? (Reports? Spreadsheets? Gut feel?)
- *Probe:* Would a visual heatmap change your workflow? Save time?
- *Probe:* On a scale of 1-10, how valuable is this?

**Q14: Who else on your team would benefit from seeing this heatmap?**
- *Probe:* Team leads? Operations managers? Real-time analysts?

*[Success Signal: Score 7+ on value scale AND "we need this" or "would save hours"]*

---

### **Section 5: Pricing & Buying (5 minutes)**

**Goal:** Validate pricing range ($20-40/agent/month) and understand buying process.

**Q15: What's your current WFM budget per agent per month?**
- *If they know:* Great—record it.
- *If they don't know:* "Roughly, is it $10? $50? $100+?"

**Q16: If a new WFM solution could reduce attrition 15-20% and improve SLA performance, what would you be willing to pay per agent per month?**
- *Let them think. Don't lead.*
- *If they hesitate:* "Would $50/agent feel reasonable? Too high? Too low?"

**Q17: Let me test a price point: How does $30/agent/month sound for a modern, intelligent WFM platform with the features we discussed?**
- *Probe:* Too expensive? A steal? About right?
- *Probe:* What would make that price feel like a no-brainer?

*[Success Signal: "Reasonable" or "We'd consider it" for $20-40 range]*

**Q18: Walk me through how you'd evaluate and buy a new WFM solution.**
- *Probe:* Who's involved in the decision? (You? VP Ops? IT? CFO?)
- *Probe:* How long does procurement take? (3 months? 12 months?)
- *Probe:* What proof do you need? (Demo? Trial? References? ROI analysis?)

*[Capture: Decision-makers, timeline, proof requirements]*

---

### **Section 6: Competitive Intel (5 minutes)**

**Goal:** Understand why they chose current WFM vendor and what would make them switch.

**Q19: Why did you choose [current WFM tool]?**
- *Probe:* Was it bundled with other software? Best features? Only option?
- *Probe:* Who else did you evaluate?

**Q20: What would it take for you to switch WFM vendors?**
- *Probe:* What's the pain threshold? (How bad does it have to get?)
- *Probe:* What features would a new vendor need to have?
- *Probe:* What concerns would you have about switching? (Data migration? Integration? Learning curve?)

**Q21: Have you seen any WFM vendors showing features like IOI scoring or CvD heatmaps?**
- *Probe:* Has NICE/Verint/Calabrio shown anything similar?
- *Probe:* Any new vendors reaching out to you lately?

*[Competitive Intel: Who they evaluated, why they chose incumbent, switching barriers]*

---

### **Closing (5 minutes)**

**Q22: If I built this—IOI scoring, CvD heatmaps, agent-friendly UX—would you want to see a demo when it's ready?**
- *Gauge interest level: "Absolutely!" vs. "Maybe" vs. "Probably not"*

**Q23: Is there anything I didn't ask that I should have?**
- *Let them share anything top-of-mind.*

**Thank You:**
> "This has been incredibly helpful. I'll send your $100 Amazon gift card within 24 hours.
>
> Last question: Would you be open to a follow-up conversation in 2-3 months when I have a prototype to show? No obligation—just if you're curious."

*[Capture: Interest level, follow-up permission]*

## Tips for Effective Interviews

### **Do:**
- ✅ Record calls (with permission) so you can focus on conversation, not notes
- ✅ Listen more than you talk (80/20 rule)
- ✅ Ask "Why?" and "Tell me more about that" to go deeper
- ✅ Embrace silence—let them think and fill the space
- ✅ Probe for specific examples: "Walk me through the last time that happened"
- ✅ Stay neutral—don't lead them to answers you want to hear

### **Don't:**
- ❌ Pitch your solution—you're learning, not selling
- ❌ Defend your ideas if they critique them—just listen
- ❌ Skip pricing questions because they're uncomfortable
- ❌ Let them ramble for 20 minutes without redirecting
- ❌ Assume you know what they mean—always clarify

### **Body Language & Reactions to Watch:**
- **Lean forward + eyes light up** = Strong interest
- **Pause + "Hmm, that's interesting"** = Genuine consideration
- **Immediate "Yes, we need that!"** = High-value feature
- **Hesitation + "Maybe..."** = Lukewarm interest (probe why)
- **Skeptical tone + "I don't know if that would work"** = Dig into objection

## Red Flag Responses (Investigate Further)

**Red Flag 1:** "Agent attrition isn't really a problem for us"
- **Dig:** What's your attrition rate? Why so low? (Maybe they're unicorn; maybe they're in denial)

**Red Flag 2:** "We already have something like IOI in our current tool"
- **Dig:** Can you show me? What's it called? (Validate competitive threat)

**Red Flag 3:** "$30/agent is way too expensive"
- **Dig:** What's your current spend? What price would work? (Pricing mismatch or value communication failure)

**Red Flag 4:** "I'm not involved in buying decisions"
- **Acknowledge:** Who should I talk to? (Wrong persona—adjust recruitment)

**Red Flag 5:** "We're locked into our current vendor for 2+ years"
- **Pivot:** Understood. Hypothetically, when your contract is up, what would you look for? (Long-term insights still valuable)
