## Executive Summary

**The Opportunity:** Five9 customers consistently request modern workforce management (WFM) capabilities beyond native offerings. We propose a strategic technology partnership to deliver intelligent WFM purpose-built for Five9 contact centers.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Customer Retention:** WFM is a top-3 buying criterion for cloud contact center platforms—customers defect to competitors with stronger WFM
- **Revenue Expansion:** Co-sell WFM at $20-40/agent/month creates $360K-720K annual revenue opportunity per 50 joint customers (10-20% to Five9)
- **Competitive Differentiation:** Position Five9 as the "complete contact center platform" vs. competitors with weak WFM

**What We're Proposing:**
- Pre-built Five9 integration (REST API, real-time data sync, certified/tested)
- Co-marketing & co-selling motion (joint webinars, customer success stories, sales enablement)
- Revenue share or referral fee structure (flexible based on Five9's preference)

**Next Step:** 30-minute exploratory call to discuss partnership fit and next steps.

## The Problem: Five9 Customers Need Modern WFM

### **Customer Pain Point**

Five9 customers consistently face workforce management challenges:

**Agent Attrition Crisis:**
- Contact centers losing 30-50% of agents annually
- #2 reason agents quit: **Unfair, unpredictable scheduling**
- Average cost per agent replacement: **$5K-15K**

**Scheduling Complexity:**
- Multi-skill routing requires sophisticated forecasting and scheduling
- Real-time adherence and intraday management are manual, error-prone
- Legacy WFM tools (NICE, Verint) designed for on-prem, not cloud-native workflows

**WFM Tool Gaps:**
- Five9 native WFM is **basic** (suitable for <100 agents, simple use cases)
- Customers outgrow native capabilities and seek **third-party solutions**
- No recommended/certified WFM partner in Five9 marketplace creates customer friction

### **Five9's Strategic Challenge**

**Competitive Pressure:**
- Genesys Cloud bundles advanced WFM (competitive advantage)
- NICE CXone integrates NICE WFM seamlessly (ecosystem lock-in)
- Five9 risks losing deals when WFM is a primary evaluation criterion

**Partner Ecosystem Gap:**
- Five9 has strong telephony, IVR, analytics capabilities
- WFM is an acknowledged gap filled by legacy vendors (NICE, Verint) customers don't love
- **Opportunity:** Partner with modern WFM vendor vs. building in-house (not core competency)

## Our Solution: Intelligent WFM for Five9 Customers

### **What We're Building**

**Modern WFM Platform Purpose-Built for Cloud Contact Centers:**

**1. Intelligent Opportunity Index (IOI) Scoring** 🚀
- Explainable 0-100 score for schedule decisions (availability + skills + fairness + impact + compliance)
- Shows agents **WHY** they were selected—builds trust, reduces unfairness complaints
- **Unique Differentiator:** No WFM vendor offers explainable multi-factor intelligence

**2. Capacity vs. Demand (CvD) Heatmap** 🚀
- Real-time visual: Red = SLA risk, Yellow = tight capacity, Green = sufficient
- Planners see coverage gaps at a glance—no more spreadsheet hunting
- **Unique Differentiator:** No competitor visualizes capacity like this

**3. Agent-Centered UX** 🚀
- Respectful notifications explaining WHAT/WHY/WHO/IMPACT of schedule changes
- Mobile-first experience (agents access schedules, swap shifts, request time off)
- Reduces attrition by treating agents as stakeholders, not resources

**4. Contact Center Domain Expertise** 🚀
- Built for SLA/service level protection (vs. retail labor cost optimization)
- Real-time adherence, interval-level scheduling (15-min intervals), occupancy management
- Understands Five9 workflows: skills-based routing, multi-channel (voice/chat/email), ACD metrics

### **Five9 Integration (Native Experience)**

**Technical Integration:**
- REST API connection to Five9 platform (agent data, schedule data, real-time adherence)
- Single sign-on (SSO) for seamless user experience
- Data sync: Agent roster, skills, historical performance, queue data
- Real-time adherence: Monitor agent status (on-call, break, off-phone) via Five9 ACD

**Certified & Supported:**
- Five9 marketplace listing (certified partner status)
- Joint support model (L1/L2 from us, escalations to Five9 if needed)
- Quarterly integration maintenance (API updates, new Five9 feature support)

**Implementation Speed:**

- Pre-configured Five9 templates (reduce customization time)
- White-glove onboarding included

## Business Case: Why This Partnership Makes Sense

### **For Five9**

**1. Strengthen Competitive Position**
- **Win Deals:** "Five9 + [Your Company] WFM" vs. "Genesys Cloud (bundled WFM)" = level playing field
- **Retain Customers:** Customers outgrow native WFM but stay with Five9 because certified partner exists
- **Expand Wallet Share:** Upsell WFM to existing Five9 base (5,000-10,000 customers = massive TAM)

**2. Revenue Opportunity (Conservative Estimate)**
- **Joint Customer Target:** 50 customers in Year 1 (1% of Five9 base)
- **Average Deal Size:** $30/agent x 200 agents x 12 months = **$72K ARR per customer**
- **Total Revenue:** 50 customers x $72K = **$3.6M ARR**
- **Five9 Share (10-20%):** **$360K-720K annual recurring revenue** (partner revenue share)

**3. Low Investment, High Return**
- **Five9's Investment:** Sales enablement, co-marketing, marketplace listing (minimal engineering)
- **We Build:** Integration, product, support (Five9 doesn't need to invest R&D)
- **ROI:** Partner revenue + customer retention + competitive wins > cost of partnership

### **For Us**

**1. Distribution & Customer Access**
- Immediate access to 5,000-10,000 Five9 customers needing WFM
- Five9 sales team becomes our channel (co-sell motion)
- Marketplace listing drives inbound leads

**2. Credibility & Validation**
- "Certified Five9 WFM Partner" = instant credibility for unknown startup
- Joint customer references accelerate enterprise sales
- Partnership validates product-market fit

**3. Integration Focus**
- Build one deep integration (Five9) vs. 10 shallow integrations
- Five9 customers are our ICP (100-500 agents, cloud-native)
- Reference architecture for future telephony integrations (Talkdesk, Amazon Connect)

---

### **Option 2: Referral Fee**

---

### **Option 3: Co-Marketing Only (Fastest to Launch)**

**Benefits:**

## Competitive Landscape: Why We're the Right Partner

### **Why Not NICE or Verint?**

**Conflict of Interest:**
- NICE and Verint compete with Five9 (they have their own telephony platforms)
- Partnering with them strengthens competitors

**Legacy Architecture:**
- Built for on-prem, not cloud-native workflows
- Slow, expensive implementations (12-18 weeks)
- Poor agent UX (designed for 2010, not 2025)

**Price:** $40-80/agent/month (2-3x our pricing)

---

### **Why Not Calabrio?**

**Decent Option, But Missing Intelligence:**
- Calabrio has modern UX but lacks intelligent automation (IOI, CvD)
- They're a competitor in QM/analytics space (potential conflict)
- Already entrenched with Genesys/other platforms

---

### **Why Not Workforce.com or Legion?**

**Not Contact Center Native:**
- Built for retail/hospitality (foot traffic optimization, not SLA protection)
- Lack contact center domain expertise (no real-time adherence, occupancy, shrinkage)
- Will take 12-18 months to catch up

---

### **Why Us?**

✅ **Contact Center Native:** Built for SLA protection, adherence, occupancy—Five9 customers' needs
✅ **No Conflict:** We don't compete with Five9 (pure WFM play)
✅ **Modern Tech Stack:** Cloud-native, API-first, fast implementations (2-4 weeks)
✅ **Unique Differentiation:** IOI + CvD + agent experience = no competitor has this
✅ **Partnership-Friendly:** Early stage = flexible, eager to co-build success

## FAQ: Anticipated Questions

**Q: "You're an unknown startup. Why should we partner with you vs. established vendors?"**

**A:** Fair question. Here's why early partnership benefits both of us:
- **Speed:** We move fast (ship features in weeks, not quarters). Established vendors have bureaucracy.
- **Flexibility:** We'll co-build features Five9 customers need. Legacy vendors won't customize for you.
- **Alignment:** We're building FOR Five9 customers (your success = our success). We don't compete with you.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Start with co-marketing (zero financial risk). Upgrade to revenue share after proof.

---

**Q: "What if you get acquired or go out of business?"**

**A:** Legitimate concern. Mitigation:
- **Acquisition Upside:** If we're acquired, Five9 could become preferred partner of acquirer (strategic value)
- **Runway:** We're well-funded with 18-24 month runway; not burning cash recklessly
- **Customer Protection:** Source code escrow for enterprise customers (continuity guarantee)

---

**Q: "How do you differentiate from Calabrio? They're also 'modern' and growing fast."**

**A:** Calabrio modernized the **interface**. We're modernizing the **intelligence**.
- Calabrio has clean UX but still requires manual planner workflows
- We offer IOI scoring (explainable AI) + CvD heatmaps (no competitor has this)
- Agent experience focus (transparency, fairness, attrition reduction) is our DNA, not an add-on

---

**Q: "Why Five9 first? Why not Genesys or Talkdesk?"**

**A:** Strategic fit:
- **Mid-Market Focus:** Five9 dominates 100-500 agent segment (our ICP)
- **Cloud-Native DNA:** Five9 customers expect modern, cloud-first tools
- **WFM Gap:** Five9 native WFM is acknowledged gap; Genesys/Talkdesk have stronger native offerings
- **Partnership Culture:** Five9 is known for partner-friendly ecosystem (vs. Genesys "build everything in-house")

That said, we'd love to expand to Talkdesk, Amazon Connect after proving success with Five9.

---

**Q: "What's your pricing? Will you undercut Five9's native WFM?"**

**A:** Pricing: $20-40/agent/month (vs. Five9 native pricing, which we assume is lower or bundled).

**Positioning:**
- Five9 native WFM is "good enough" for <100 agents, simple use cases
- We're the "enterprise-grade" option for customers outgrowing native capabilities
- Not competitive—**complementary**. We expand the pie (customers who'd otherwise go to NICE/Verint).
