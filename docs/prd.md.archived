# Intelligent WFM Scheduling Demo Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Author:** John (PM Agent)
**Project Type:** Demo/Proof-of-Concept

---

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Demonstrate intelligent scheduling concepts (IOI scoring, CvD awareness, break optimization) in a visually impressive, interactive demo
- Showcase BMAD™ methodology and analysis framework capabilities through high-quality product thinking
- Create a portfolio-ready proof-of-concept that runs on any modern browser without backend infrastructure
- Deliver a professional, slick UI that feels like enterprise software, not a prototype
- Prove technical feasibility of CvD-integrated intelligent scheduling with explainable AI scoring
- Enable 5-10 minute demo flow showcasing all six core features interactively

### Background Context

Contact center WFM planners currently spend 30-45 minutes manually finding meeting slots for 10 agents, with no visibility into service level impact. Existing enterprise WFM platforms (NICE, Verint, Calabrio) have Capacity vs Demand data buried in reports rather than integrated into scheduling workflows, and offer no AI-driven slot recommendations or intelligent break optimization.

This demo addresses a validated feature gap in the market: no competitor offers CvD-integrated intelligent scheduling with explainable IOI scoring. By building a client-side React demo with realistic contact center data, we can prove the concept is technically feasible and visually compelling—establishing differentiation for potential future product development or partnership opportunities (e.g., Five9 integration as referenced in supplemental docs).

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The system shall display an interactive CvD (Capacity vs Demand) heatmap showing coverage percentage by 15-minute interval across a 7-day week view, with color-coding (red <90%, yellow 90-105%, green >105%).

**FR2:** The system shall provide hover tooltips on heatmap cells showing quick stats (coverage %, agents scheduled, forecasted demand).

**FR3:** The system shall open a detailed popup when a heatmap cell is clicked, displaying agents scheduled, skills breakdown, and forecasted call volume.

**FR4:** The system shall calculate an Intelligent Opportunity Index (IOI) score (0-100) for candidate time slots based on four factors: CvD Safety (0-30 pts), Availability Density (0-25 pts), Compliance Integrity (0-25 pts), and Basic Fairness (0-20 pts).

**FR5:** The system shall display top 5 ranked time slots with IOI scores and expandable factor breakdowns when users search for meeting times.

**FR6:** The system shall provide a visual Outlook-style calendar interface showing agent schedules in a grid format (time x agents or time x days).

**FR7:** The system shall display color-coded activity blocks for different types: shifts (blue), breaks (orange), lunch (purple), meetings (green), training (teal), off-phone activities (yellow).

**FR8:** The system shall allow users to add new activities via click-to-add functionality that opens a modal for selecting activity type, duration, and attendees.

**FR9:** The system shall support drag-and-drop interactions to move activity blocks to different times.

**FR10:** The system shall provide an agent side panel with scrollable list, multi-select checkboxes, and search/filter by name or skill.

**FR11:** The system shall implement a smart scheduling search workflow that accepts meeting parameters (title, duration, attendees, date range, priority) and returns IOI-ranked recommendations.

**FR12:** The system shall propose intelligent break adjustments when no conflict-free slots exist, moving breaks/lunches within compliance rules (2hr minimum between breaks, 5hr max without break, 30min lunch duration).

**FR13:** The system shall display before/after schedule comparison when break adjustments are proposed.

**FR14:** The system shall update the CvD heatmap in real-time as users add or remove activities from the calendar.

**FR15:** The system shall maintain an audit trail event log capturing timestamp, user, action, affected agents, IOI scores, coverage impact, and decision rationale.

**FR16:** The system shall provide filters on the audit log (date range, user, action type, agent search).

**FR17:** The system shall export audit log data to CSV format.

**FR18:** The system shall display agent notification preview mockups showing human-centered communication (what, why, who, impact, selection rationale).

**FR19:** The system shall show agent history view displaying past schedule changes in table format.

**FR20:** The system shall load demo data from JSON files (50-100 agents, weekly schedules, CvD forecast, compliance rules) within 2 seconds (stretch target: 1 second).

**FR21:** The system shall gracefully handle invalid inputs, missing data files, and out-of-range dates without crashing, displaying user-friendly error messages.

**FR22:** The system shall display clear loading indicators during data load and informative empty states for filtered-out views (heatmap, audit log, search results).

**FR23:** The system shall include a reset/demo mode button that restores initial demo data and state for multiple demonstration run-throughs.

**FR24:** The system shall validate demo data (JSON structure, required fields) at load time and display an error message if malformed data is detected.

**FR25:** The system shall display version information and build timestamp (e.g., "v2.0, Built Oct 2025") in the application footer or about section.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** The system shall run entirely client-side in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) without requiring backend infrastructure or external APIs.

**NFR2:** The system shall respond to user interactions (clicks, hovers, drag-and-drop) within 200ms to ensure smooth, professional feel.

**NFR3:** The system shall calculate IOI scores for 50+ candidate time slots within 500ms.

**NFR4:** The system shall be mobile-responsive and functional on tablet devices for demo purposes.

**NFR14:** The system shall be verified on latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, with graceful degradation on Edge.

**NFR15:** Resetting the demo state (FR23) shall complete within 1 second to support seamless live presentation flow.

### Requirements Context & Dependencies

**Data Dependencies:**
All feature components require successful loading of core demo data files before initialization:
- `agents.json` - Agent roster with skills and shifts
- `schedules.json` - Weekly schedule data (shifts, breaks, lunches, activities)
- `cvd-forecast.json` - Forecasted demand by 15-minute interval
- `compliance-rules.json` - Break spacing rules and labor constraints

**Scope Constraints:**
- No external APIs or authentication systems per demo scope
- No server-side processing or database storage
- No integration with real WFM platforms (NICE, Verint, Calabrio)
- No actual notification delivery (preview mockups only)

**Testing & Sign-Off:**
- Performance targets validated under demo data load (50-100 agents)
- Error handling scenarios include: missing files, malformed JSON, invalid date ranges, empty search results
- Accessibility validated via automated tools (Axe, Lighthouse) and manual keyboard navigation testing

---

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The application shall embody a **professional enterprise WFM tool aesthetic** with the interactivity and polish of modern SaaS products like Notion or Linear. The user experience should feel **slick, intelligent, and trustworthy**—conveying that this is a sophisticated scheduling assistant, not a prototype.

**Key UX Principles:**
- **Intelligent focus over mass visibility:** Surface relevant agents based on context (skills, availability, IOI scoring) rather than overwhelming with all 50-100 agents simultaneously
- **Clarity over cleverness:** Critical information (IOI scores, coverage %, compliance status) always visible and understandable at a glance
- **Progressive disclosure:** Start with aggregated/summary views, drill down to individual schedules on demand
- **Immediate feedback:** Visual confirmation of all actions (adding meetings, adjusting breaks, filtering logs) within 200ms
- **Data-driven confidence:** Show the math behind recommendations (explainable IOI breakdowns) to build trust
- **Demo-optimized flow:** Support rapid "wow moment" discoveries (click heatmap → see CvD detail → search for slot → system proposes best agents → see IOI magic → book → see audit trail)

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Heatmap-Centric Navigation:**
The CvD heatmap serves as the **visual anchor** and primary navigation point. Users naturally gravitate to color-coded risk zones (red/yellow/green), click to explore details, then transition to **filtered calendar view of relevant agents** for scheduling actions. The heatmap shows aggregate team-level service risk; individual agent schedules are revealed contextually.

**Wizard-Style Smart Search with Dynamic Agent Selection:**
Finding optimal meeting times follows a **guided workflow**:
1. Input parameters (attendees OR skill requirements, duration, date range)
2. **System proposes which agents best fit** based on IOI scoring (availability, fairness, compliance)
3. Review ranked slot recommendations with scores and proposed agent subset
4. Select slot (or accept break adjustment) → Calendar auto-filters to show only affected agents
5. Confirm booking

This eliminates cognitive overload—users see only the agents the system recommends, not all 100 simultaneously.

**Filtered/Focused Calendar Views:**
Calendar interactions mirror **Outlook/Google Calendar muscle memory** (drag to move, click to add, resize blocks) but with **intelligent scoping**:
- **Default view:** Summary mode showing aggregated team coverage (not individual schedules)
- **Filtered views:** "Top 10 by availability," "Selected team/skill group," "Agents affected by current action"
- **Detail mode toggle:** Expand from summary → individual agent schedules for focused subset
- **Smart Focus button:** Auto-filter calendar to only agents relevant to current IOI recommendation

**Audit Trail as Safety Net:**
The event log provides **accountability transparency**—every action is logged with full context (including which agent subset was affected). Users can confidently experiment knowing decisions are traceable and explainable for post-demo review.

### Core Screens and Views

**1. Main Dashboard (Default View)**
- **Layout:** Split-screen with CvD heatmap (left 40%) and **aggregated team coverage view** (right 60%)
- **Purpose:** At-a-glance service level risk awareness across entire team, with on-demand drill-down to specific agent schedules
- **Key Elements:**
  - Date picker
  - "Add Activity" / "Smart Search" buttons
  - **View mode switcher:** Summary (team coverage bars) / Filtered Group / Individual Schedules
  - Agent filter panel (collapsible): Filter by skill, team, availability, or "Show All"
  - **Agent grouping controls:** "Top 10 by availability," "Selected skill group," "Custom selection"
- **Default State:** Shows team-level coverage summary (not 100 individual rows)—clean, digestible, fast

**2. CvD Heatmap Detail Modal**
- **Trigger:** Click any heatmap cell
- **Purpose:** Deep-dive into specific time interval coverage
- **Content:**
  - Aggregated metrics: Total agents scheduled, forecasted demand, coverage %, risk level
  - **Top agents by availability** in that slot (expandable list)
  - Skills breakdown for scheduled agents
  - "View affected agents in calendar" button → filters calendar to show agents working that interval

**3. Smart Scheduling Search Modal**
- **Trigger:** "Find Best Time" button or "Add Meeting" → "Use Smart Search"
- **Purpose:** IOI-driven slot recommendation workflow **with dynamic agent selection**
- **Content:**
  - **Step 1 (Input):** Meeting title, duration, date range, priority
    - **Agent selection mode:** "Let system recommend" OR "Manually select agents" OR "Skill requirements" (e.g., "5 agents with Spanish + Technical skills")
  - **Step 2 (Results):** Top 5 ranked slots with IOI scores
    - **For each slot:** Shows which agents system proposes (based on availability, fairness, compliance)
    - Preview: "Slot 1 (IOI 92): Sarah, Mike, Lisa, John, Emma" with mini-avatars
  - **Step 3 (Break Adjustment):** If needed, show proposed break moves for recommended agents
  - **Step 4 (Confirmation):** "Meeting booked. Calendar filtered to show 5 affected agents."

**4. Calendar Week View (Contextual/Filtered)**
- **Layout:** Time-of-day rows (7am-7pm, 15-min intervals) x **Selected agents (configurable subset)** OR **Aggregated coverage summary row**
- **Purpose:** Manage and visualize **filtered or relevant agent schedules** for the selected context (not all agents simultaneously)
- **View Modes:**
  - **Summary Mode (Default):** Single row showing team coverage % by interval (heatmap-style bar chart)
  - **Filtered Group Mode:** Show 5-20 agents based on current filter (skill, team, IOI recommendation)
  - **Individual Schedule Mode:** Drill down to specific agents on demand (click agent → expand their full schedule)
- **Interactions:**
  - Drag-and-drop activities within visible subset
  - Click-to-add (auto-suggests agent subset via IOI if needed)
  - Hover for details
  - Multi-select agents from filtered list (not all 100)
  - **Pagination/virtual scrolling** if filtered subset exceeds 20 agents (performance optimization)

**5. Agent Notification Preview Panel**
- **Trigger:** Click "View Agent Impact" or dedicated "Notifications" tab
- **Purpose:** Demonstrate human-centered communication design
- **Content:** 3-4 example notification cards showing different scenarios (meeting added, break adjusted, training scheduled)
- **Context:** Notifications reference agents from recently viewed filtered subset (not abstract "all agents")

**6. Audit Trail View**
- **Layout:** Full-width table below or beside calendar (toggleable)
- **Purpose:** Event log for accountability and decision traceability
- **Features:** Sortable columns, filters (date range, user, action type, affected agents), CSV export button
- **Context Note:** Audit trail reflects actions on **filtered subsets of agents** rather than global schedule modifications

**7. About/Help Modal**
- **Trigger:** Info icon or "About" link in footer
- **Purpose:** Explain demo scope, feature highlights, version info
- **Content:** Brief overview, feature list, version/build timestamp, credits

### Optional Forward-Thinking Enhancements (Not MVP, Note for Future)

**Mini Heatmaps per Agent:**
Tiny sparkline-style tiles showing each agent's workload distribution across the week; clicking expands to their full schedule.

**Cluster View:**
Summarize agents by skill group, region, or team; expand one cluster at a time. Example: "Technical Support (25 agents) | Spanish Bilingual (18 agents) | Team Leads (8 agents)" → click to drill down.

**"Smart Focus" Button:**
When the system recommends a slot during Smart Search, auto-filter the calendar to **only affected agents** with highlight/focus animation.

**Agent Comparison View:**
Side-by-side view of 2-4 agents for comparing availability, recent activity history, IOI fairness scores.

### Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA

**Color Contrast:**
- All text meets 4.5:1 contrast ratio (3:1 for large text >18pt)
- Heatmap colors (red/yellow/green) supplemented with patterns or icons for colorblind users
- Focus indicators visible on all interactive elements (2px outline, high contrast)

**Keyboard Navigation (Simplified for Filtered Views):**
- Full tab-order support: Calendar grid (visible subset only) → Agent panel → Modals → Buttons
- **Navigation scope:** Keyboard nav operates within **visible filtered subset** only (not all 100 agents)—improves performance and usability
- Arrow keys navigate visible calendar cells, Enter/Space to select
- **Pagination controls:** Tab to "Next 20 agents" / "Previous 20 agents" buttons if subset exceeds one page
- Esc key closes modals and cancels workflows
- Skip links to bypass repetitive navigation (e.g., "Skip to calendar")

**Screen Reader Support:**
- ARIA labels on heatmap cells: "Tuesday 2:00 PM, Coverage 92%, Green zone, Safe"
- Live regions announce dynamic updates: "Meeting added to Tuesday 2 PM for 8 agents, Coverage updated to 98%"
- **Filter state announcements:** "Showing 10 agents: Technical skill group"
- Form inputs properly labeled, error messages associated with fields

**Practical Scope for Demo:**
Focus accessibility efforts on **high-impact, low-effort wins** appropriate for a demo:
- Color contrast (automatic via Shadcn/Tailwind)
- Keyboard navigation within filtered subsets (built into React components, no 100-row grid complexity)
- Basic ARIA labels (semantic HTML + strategic aria-label additions)
- Skip full screen reader optimization for complex grid interactions (note as future enhancement)

### Branding

**Design Language:**
Modern, data-centric enterprise SaaS aesthetic inspired by:
- **Notion:** Clean, minimal, generous white space, subtle shadows
- **Linear:** Crisp typography, muted color palette, smooth animations
- **Tableau:** Professional data visualization, clear hierarchies, trust-building precision

**Color Palette:**
- **Primary:** Slate/blue-gray (neutral, professional)
- **Accent:** Teal/cyan (intelligent, tech-forward) for CTAs and highlights
- **Semantic:**
  - Green: Safe/success (high coverage, compliant, positive IOI)
  - Yellow: Caution (tight coverage, needs attention)
  - Red: Risk/error (low coverage, violations, conflicts)
  - Blue: Informational (standard shifts)
  - Purple: Important (lunch breaks)
  - Orange: Moderate (short breaks)

**Typography:**
- **Headings:** Inter or Geist (clean, modern sans-serif)
- **Body:** System font stack for performance (SF Pro, Segoe UI, Roboto)
- **Data/Scores:** Tabular figures (monospace numbers) for alignment in tables

**Iconography:**
- **Primary:** Lucide icons (open-source, consistent style, optimized SVGs) for UI controls
- **Activity types:** SVG icons styled to match Lucide aesthetic (avoid emojis for enterprise professional feel)
  - Alternative: Use emojis (🍽️☕👥📚💬📊) if user testing shows they improve quick recognition without undermining professionalism—design decision deferred to UX Architect

**Visual Effects:**
- Subtle shadows for depth (cards, modals, dropdowns)
- Smooth transitions (150-200ms) on hover, click, drag
- **Focus animations:** When Smart Search recommends agents, subtle highlight/pulse on affected calendar rows
- No flashy animations—professional restraint
- Loading states: Skeleton screens (not spinners) to maintain visual structure

### Target Platforms: Web Responsive

**Primary Target:** Desktop browsers (1920x1080 and 1440x900 most common)
- Optimized for laptop/monitor demo scenarios
- Full feature set accessible

**Secondary Target:** Tablet landscape (iPad 10.2", 1080p tablets)
- Calendar grid adapts to narrower viewport (fewer agents visible by default, horizontal scroll for filtered subsets)
- Heatmap remains interactive, modals adjust to screen size
- Touch-friendly targets (44px minimum tap areas)

**Out of Scope:** Mobile phone optimization
- Not designed for <768px width
- Graceful degradation: Show "Best viewed on tablet or desktop" message on small screens

**Browser Support:**
- Chrome 120+ (primary testing)
- Firefox 121+ (secondary testing)
- Safari 17+ (macOS/iOS testing)
- Edge 120+ (graceful degradation, not optimized)

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

**Decision:** Single repository containing all frontend code, demo data, configuration, and documentation.

**Rationale:**
- **Demo scope simplicity:** No need for polyrepo complexity with separate frontend/backend/data repos
- **Zero deployment friction:** Single `git clone` → `npm install` → `npm run dev` workflow
- **Vercel/Netlify compatibility:** Both platforms expect single-repo React projects for auto-deploy
- **Open-source readability:** Single-repo organization optimized for GitHub discoverability, not long-term modularity

**Structure:**
```
/wfm-intelligence-demo
  /src              (React components, logic, types, hooks)
  /public
    /demo-data      (agents.json, schedules.json, cvd-forecast.json, compliance-rules.json)
  /docs             (Brief, PRD, architecture diagrams - at root for GitHub visibility)
  package.json
  vite.config.ts
  README.md
```

**Note:** `/public/demo-data/` placement simplifies Vercel's static file serving and clarifies demo scope.

### Service Architecture: Client-Side Monolith (No Backend)

**Decision:** All intelligence and business logic runs in the browser using TypeScript. No server-side APIs, databases, or authentication.

**Rationale:**
- **Demo constraint:** Zero infrastructure cost requirement eliminates backend options
- **Proof-of-concept scope:** Demonstrates scheduling algorithms and UX concepts, not production engineering
- **Deployment simplicity:** Static site hosting (Vercel free tier) with instant global CDN
- **Portability:** Demo runs locally (`npm run dev`) or via shared URL—no server setup required
- **Performance:** Modern browsers handle 50-100 agent calculations client-side without latency

**What Runs Client-Side:**
- IOI scoring algorithm (pure TypeScript function)
- Break adjustment logic (compliance validation, optimization)
- CvD coverage calculation (agents vs. demand)
- State management (Zustand or React Context)
- Data loading (fetch JSON from `/public/demo-data/`)
- Audit log (in-memory array, CSV export)

**Trade-off Statement:**
The chosen architecture **intentionally sacrifices persistence, role management, and API integration in exchange for immediate demo usability and visual impact**. This is not an extensible platform foundation.

### Technical Scope Limitations

**Explicit Exclusions (Not In Scope):**
- ❌ **No offline mode:** Demo requires network connection to load assets
- ❌ **No data editing persistence:** Schedule changes persist only in session memory; refreshing the page resets to initial demo state
- ❌ **No API consumption:** All data is static JSON—no external WFM platform integration
- ❌ **No authentication or multi-user sessions:** Single-user demo with no login, no role-based access control
- ❌ **No environment variables or secrets:** Fully static build with no configuration requirements

**Browser Cache / Refresh Behavior:**
- App resets to initial state on refresh; no caching of schedule edits beyond session memory
- Users can use "Reset Demo" button (FR23) to restore initial state without refreshing

**Purpose:** Prevents scope creep disguised as "tiny enhancements." This is a demonstration, not a production foundation.

### Testing and Validation Strategy

**Philosophy:** Testing effort is designed to **demonstrate algorithm correctness and UI stability**, not production QA coverage.

**Testing Scope:**

**Unit Tests (High Priority):**
- `ioiCalculator.test.ts` - All four IOI factors (CvD safety, availability, compliance, fairness)
- `breakAdjuster.test.ts` - Compliance rules enforcement (2hr min between breaks, 5hr max without break)
- `conflictDetector.test.ts` - Schedule overlap detection
- `coverageCalculator.test.ts` - CvD percentage calculation accuracy

**Integration Tests (Medium Priority):**
- Smart Search workflow (input parameters → IOI ranking → slot selection)
- Calendar state updates (add activity → heatmap recalculates → audit log records)
- Filter/subset logic (skill-based filtering, agent grouping)

**Manual Validation (Primary Assurance Method for End-to-End Flows):**
- Full demo flow walkthrough (5-10 min scenario) on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Responsive layout checks (desktop 1920x1080, laptop 1440x900, tablet iPad)
- Error state verification (missing JSON file, malformed data, invalid date ranges)
- **Accessibility audits:** Lighthouse + Axe DevTools run **once before demo sign-off** (not integrated into CI)

**Out of Scope (Not Essential for Demo):**
- ❌ E2E tests (Playwright/Cypress) - manual validation sufficient for POC
- ❌ Visual regression tests (Percy/Chromatic) - no design system to protect
- ❌ Performance benchmarking - demo data size is fixed, manual validation adequate
- ❌ Load/stress testing - single-user client-side app

**Rationale:**
- **Unit tests protect algorithms:** IOI scoring and compliance logic are differentiators—must be provably correct
- **Manual validation confirms UX:** Demo success depends on smooth interactions, not test coverage %
- **Time investment:** Focus effort on features that impress (slick UI, smart recommendations) vs. invisible infrastructure

**Testing Framework:**
- **Vitest** (Vite-native, fast, TypeScript support)
- **React Testing Library** (integration tests for component interactions)

**Accessibility Validation (Not "Testing"):**
- **Axe DevTools** browser extension (manual accessibility audits)
- **Lighthouse** in Chrome DevTools (automated accessibility scoring)
- Note: Accessibility audits validate WCAG compliance (NFR11), not functional correctness

### Performance Targets

**Measurable Benchmarks (Linked to NFRs):**
- **Initial load:** < 2 seconds (FR20)
- **Interaction latency:** < 200ms for clicks, hovers, drag-and-drop (NFR2)
- **IOI recomputation:** < 500ms for 50+ candidate slots (NFR3)
- **Demo reset:** < 1 second (NFR15)

**Optimization Strategies:**
- **Lazy loading** for heavy components (Calendar, Heatmap) via `React.lazy()` + `Suspense`
- **Memoization** for expensive calculations (IOI scoring, coverage) via `useMemo`
- **Virtual scrolling** enabled if active subset exceeds 25 agents via `react-window` or `@tanstack/react-virtual`
- **Debouncing** for search/filter inputs (300ms delay) via `lodash.debounce` or custom hook

**Rationale:** Demo must feel fast and responsive. Benchmarks ensure continuity with NFR performance requirements.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

#### Frontend Framework & Build Tool
- **React 18+** with TypeScript for type safety and modern hooks (useState, useEffect, custom hooks)
- **Vite** as build tool (fastest dev server, optimized production builds, better DX than CRA)
- **Strict TypeScript** (`strict: true` in tsconfig.json) to catch bugs at compile time

**Rationale:** React is industry standard for complex UIs, TypeScript prevents runtime errors during demos, Vite provides instant HMR (<50ms).

#### UI Component Library & Styling
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling (no custom CSS files, consistent design system)
- **Shadcn/ui** for accessible, customizable components (buttons, modals, tables, cards)
- **Recharts** or **Nivo** for CvD heatmap visualization (declarative, React-friendly charting)
- **React Big Calendar** or **FullCalendar** for Outlook-style schedule grid (proven libraries, reduce custom code)
- **React DnD** or **dnd-kit** for drag-and-drop interactions (smooth, touch-friendly)
- **Lucide React** for icons (modern, tree-shakeable, consistent style)

**Rationale:** Shadcn/Tailwind combination provides professional aesthetic with zero design effort. Existing calendar libraries save weeks of custom grid implementation.

#### State Management
- **Zustand** (preferred) or **React Context API** for global state
- No Redux—overkill for demo scope

**State to Manage:**
- Agent roster (50-100 agents from `agents.json`)
- Schedule activities (shifts, breaks, lunches, meetings from `schedules.json`)
- CvD forecast data (15-min intervals from `cvd-forecast.json`)
- Compliance rules (break spacing from `compliance-rules.json`)
- UI state (selected agents, active filters, modal open/closed)
- Audit log (in-memory event array)

**Rationale:** Zustand is lightweight (1KB), simple API, no boilerplate. Context API is acceptable fallback if team prefers zero dependencies for state.

#### Date/Time Handling
- **date-fns** (preferred) or **Day.js** for date manipulation, formatting, and timezone safety
- Avoid Moment.js (deprecated, large bundle size)

**Rationale:** Date-fns is modular (tree-shakeable), immutable (prevents bugs), well-documented. Contact center scheduling is time-sensitive—need reliable date math.

#### Data Format & Storage
- **JSON files** in `/public/demo-data/` folder for demo data (agents, schedules, forecast, rules)
- **CSV export** capability for audit log (use `papaparse` or custom function)
- **No database:** All data loaded into memory on app initialization

**Sample Data Structure:**
- `agents.json` - 50-100 sample agents (realistic names via faker.js, varied skills, realistic shifts)
- `schedules.json` - Weekly schedules with shifts, breaks, lunches, pre-existing meetings
- `cvd-forecast.json` - Forecasted call volume by 15-min interval (realistic peaks: 10am-12pm, 2pm-4pm)
- `compliance-rules.json` - Break spacing rules, max hours without break, lunch duration requirements

**Rationale:** JSON is human-readable, easy to edit for demo variations, no database complexity. Faker.js generates realistic demo data quickly.

#### Code Organization & Architecture Patterns
- **Feature-based folder structure:**
  ```
  /src
    /components
      /Calendar       (calendar grid, activity blocks, drag-and-drop)
      /CvDHeatmap     (heatmap visualization, detail modal)
      /SmartSearch    (search modal, IOI results, break adjustment UI)
      /AuditLog       (event log table, filters, CSV export)
      /AgentPanel     (agent list, filtering, multi-select)
      /ui             (Shadcn components: Button, Dialog, Table, Card)
    /logic
      ioiCalculator.ts
      breakAdjuster.ts
      conflictDetector.ts
      coverageCalculator.ts
    /data
      loadDemoData.ts
      validation.ts
    /types
      index.ts        (Agent, Activity, CvDDataPoint, IOIResult interfaces)
    /hooks
      useAgentFilter.ts
      useScheduleState.ts
      useIOIScoring.ts
    /utils
      dateHelpers.ts
      csvExport.ts
  ```

- **Separation of concerns:** Business logic (IOI calculation, compliance) separate from UI components
- **Custom hooks** for reusable stateful logic (filtering, search, state updates)
- **Pure functions** for algorithms (testable, no side effects)

**Rationale:** Feature-based structure scales better than "components/utils/lib" for complex UIs. Pure logic functions enable thorough unit testing.

#### Error Handling & Validation
- **JSON schema validation** on data load (validate structure of agents.json, schedules.json) via `zod` or `yup`
- **Graceful degradation:** Missing data files → show error message via visible UI (toast/banner), don't crash
- **Input validation:** Date ranges, duration values, agent selection (prevent invalid Smart Search queries)
- **Fallback values:** IOI score NaN → fallback to 0, display warning in console
- **Validation errors surface via visible UI messages (toast/banner), not console-only**
- **Error boundaries:** React Error Boundary component wraps main app (catch render errors, show friendly message)

**Rationale:** Demo stability is critical—"white screen of death" kills credibility. Validation catches data editing mistakes early. User-facing error messages maintain professional appearance.

#### Deployment & Hosting
- **Vercel** (preferred) for auto-deploy from GitHub main branch
  - Free tier: Unlimited deploys, global CDN, automatic HTTPS
  - Zero config: `vite.config.ts` auto-detected
  - Preview URLs for PR branches (useful for stakeholder review)
  - **No environment variables or secrets required**
- **Netlify** (fallback) if Vercel has issues
- **GitHub Pages** (not recommended) - slower deploys, no preview URLs

**Deployment Process:**
1. Push to GitHub `main` branch
2. Vercel auto-builds via `npm run build`
3. Deploys to `wfm-demo.vercel.app` (or custom domain)
4. Share URL for demos/portfolio

**Rationale:** Vercel is zero-config, instant deploys, free for demos. Preview URLs let stakeholders review changes before merging.

#### Development Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- **Node.js 18+** (LTS version for stability)
- **pnpm** (preferred) or **npm** for package management

**Code Quality (Required):**
- **ESLint** with TypeScript rules (catch errors, enforce conventions)
- **Prettier** for consistent formatting (2-space indent, single quotes, trailing commas)
- **TypeScript strict mode** (`strict: true`)

**Developer Convenience (Recommended, Not Required):**
- **VS Code** with extensions: ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind IntelliSense, TypeScript
- **Husky** + **lint-staged** for pre-commit hooks (auto-format, run lints) - optional, not architectural
- **Conventional commits** (e.g., `feat: add IOI scoring`) - nice-to-have for readable history

**Rationale:** ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript strictness prevent bugs and style debates. Pre-commit hooks and VS Code extensions are developer productivity aids, not requirements.

### Dependencies & Constraints Summary

**Hard Constraints:**
- ✅ No backend infrastructure (client-side only)
- ✅ No authentication or user management (single-user demo)
- ✅ No external APIs (all data from local JSON)
- ✅ Zero hosting cost (Vercel free tier)
- ✅ Demo data only (no production data, no PII)
- ✅ No environment variables or secrets

**Key Dependencies (Must Load Before App Initialization):**
1. `/public/demo-data/agents.json` - Agent roster with skills, shifts

3. `/public/demo-data/cvd-forecast.json` - Forecasted demand data
4. `/public/demo-data/compliance-rules.json` - Break spacing rules

**Technology Stack Summary Table:**

| Area | Decision | Trade-off |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Architecture** | Client-side monolith | No persistence or multi-user support |
| **Framework** | React 18 + Vite + TypeScript | Browser-only, no SSR |
| **UI Stack** | Tailwind + Shadcn/ui | No custom design system |
| **State** | Zustand (or Context API) | In-memory only, resets on refresh |
| **Testing** | Unit tests + manual validation | No E2E automation |
| **Hosting** | Vercel free tier | No custom backend or APIs |

## Epic Sequencing Rationale

**Why This Order:**

1. **Epic 1 (Foundation)** must come first—establishes infrastructure, validates tooling, de-risks deployment. Delivers working "Hello World" deployed to Vercel.

2. **Epic 2 (Heatmap)** next because it's the **primary differentiator** and provides visual impact early. Also establishes coverage calculation logic needed by Epic 4 (IOI scoring depends on CvD data).

3. **Epic 3 (Calendar)** follows because Smart Search (Epic 4) requires a calendar to display results. Calendar also provides the interaction surface for demonstrating filtered views.

4. **Epic 4 (IOI Scoring)** builds on Epic 2 (uses CvD data) and Epic 3 (displays recommendations in calendar). This is the "intelligence" layer that ties together heatmap awareness with scheduling actions.

5. **Epic 5 (Audit Trail)** can only be populated after scheduling workflows exist (Epic 3-4). Notifications preview requires context from real scheduling actions.

6. **Epic 6 (Polish)** naturally comes last—error handling, accessibility, and performance tuning happen once features are functionally complete.

**Dependencies:**
- Epic 2 → Epic 4 (IOI scoring uses CvD coverage data)
- Epic 3 → Epic 4 (Smart Search displays results in calendar)
- Epic 3 + Epic 4 → Epic 5 (Audit log captures scheduling actions)
- All Epics → Epic 6 (Polish happens after features exist)

**Deployment Cadence:**
Each epic delivers a **fully deployable increment**:
- Epic 1: Working app shell + data pipeline
- Epic 2: Heatmap visualization live
- Epic 3: Calendar + heatmap integrated
- Epic 4: Full smart scheduling workflow
- Epic 5: Complete audit + transparency features
- Epic 6: Demo-ready, polished product
