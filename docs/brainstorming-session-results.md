### Insights & Learnings
*Key realizations from the session*

- **"Lines on a spreadsheet" insight**: Current WFM systems dehumanize agents through administrative-first design; human-centered approach is competitive differentiator

- **Service protection must be embedded, not optional**: Systems that allow service-risking overrides will always fail under pressure; validation gates and auto-prevention are architectural requirements

- **Intelligence needs quantification for trust**: Abstract AI feels risky; IOI scores (0-100), confidence percentages, and transparent reasoning build user confidence

- **Invisible automation requires visible audit trails**: The more autonomous the system, the more critical complete transparency becomes for accountability and trust

- **Multi-persona design is essential**: Features that serve only one stakeholder create friction elsewhere; successful WFM must orchestrate across Team Leads, Agents, Planners, and Ops Managers

- **Fairness is a scoring factor, not an afterthought**: Disruption spread and historical impact tracking prevent systemic unfairness that breeds disengagement

- **Learning from overrides is competitive moat**: Systems that get smarter from human corrections create compounding value; static rules engines become outdated

- **CvD heatmap is the nervous system**: Nearly every intelligent feature relies on real-time capacity vs demand visibility; this becomes the platform's data backbone
