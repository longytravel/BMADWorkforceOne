# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Intelligent WFM Scheduling Demo**, including backend systems (simulated client-side), frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Status:** N/A - Greenfield Project

This is a greenfield proof-of-concept with no existing codebase or starter template. The PRD explicitly defines this as a client-side demo built from scratch with zero backend infrastructure.

**Recommendation:** Use `npm create vite@latest wfm-intelligence-demo -- --template react-ts` as the initialization point, which provides:
- React 18+ with TypeScript configured
- Vite build tooling optimized for performance
- ESLint and basic project structure
- Fast HMR (<50ms as specified in PRD)
