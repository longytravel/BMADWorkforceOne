# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The application shall embody a **professional enterprise WFM tool aesthetic** with the interactivity and polish of modern SaaS products like Notion or Linear. The user experience should feel **slick, intelligent, and trustworthy**—conveying that this is a sophisticated scheduling assistant, not a prototype.

**Key UX Principles:**
- **Intelligent focus over mass visibility:** Surface relevant agents based on context (skills, availability, IOI scoring) rather than overwhelming with all 50-100 agents simultaneously
- **Clarity over cleverness:** Critical information (IOI scores, coverage %, compliance status) always visible and understandable at a glance
- **Progressive disclosure:** Start with aggregated/summary views, drill down to individual schedules on demand
- **Immediate feedback:** Visual confirmation of all actions (adding meetings, adjusting breaks, filtering logs) within 200ms
- **Data-driven confidence:** Show the math behind recommendations (explainable IOI breakdowns) to build trust
- **Demo-optimized flow:** Support rapid "wow moment" discoveries (click heatmap → see CvD detail → search for slot → system proposes best agents → see IOI magic → book → see audit trail)

## Key Interaction Paradigms

**Heatmap-Centric Navigation:**
The CvD heatmap serves as the **visual anchor** and primary navigation point. Users naturally gravitate to color-coded risk zones (red/yellow/green), click to explore details, then transition to **filtered calendar view of relevant agents** for scheduling actions. The heatmap shows aggregate team-level service risk; individual agent schedules are revealed contextually.

**Wizard-Style Smart Search with Dynamic Agent Selection:**
Finding optimal meeting times follows a **guided workflow**:
1. Input parameters (attendees OR skill requirements, duration, date range)
2. **System proposes which agents best fit** based on IOI scoring (availability, fairness, compliance)
3. Review ranked slot recommendations with scores and proposed agent subset
4. Select slot (or accept break adjustment) → Calendar auto-filters to show only affected agents
5. Confirm booking

This eliminates cognitive overload—users see only the agents the system recommends, not all 100 simultaneously.

**Filtered/Focused Calendar Views:**
Calendar interactions mirror **Outlook/Google Calendar muscle memory** (drag to move, click to add, resize blocks) but with **intelligent scoping**:
- **Default view:** Summary mode showing aggregated team coverage (not individual schedules)
- **Filtered views:** "Top 10 by availability," "Selected team/skill group," "Agents affected by current action"
- **Detail mode toggle:** Expand from summary → individual agent schedules for focused subset
- **Smart Focus button:** Auto-filter calendar to only agents relevant to current IOI recommendation

**Audit Trail as Safety Net:**
The event log provides **accountability transparency**—every action is logged with full context (including which agent subset was affected). Users can confidently experiment knowing decisions are traceable and explainable for post-demo review.

## Core Screens and Views

**1. Main Dashboard (Default View)**
- **Layout:** Split-screen with CvD heatmap (left 40%) and **aggregated team coverage view** (right 60%)
- **Purpose:** At-a-glance service level risk awareness across entire team, with on-demand drill-down to specific agent schedules
- **Key Elements:**
  - Date picker
  - "Add Activity" / "Smart Search" buttons
  - **View mode switcher:** Summary (team coverage bars) / Filtered Group / Individual Schedules
  - Agent filter panel (collapsible): Filter by skill, team, availability, or "Show All"
  - **Agent grouping controls:** "Top 10 by availability," "Selected skill group," "Custom selection"
- **Default State:** Shows team-level coverage summary (not 100 individual rows)—clean, digestible, fast

**2. CvD Heatmap Detail Modal**
- **Trigger:** Click any heatmap cell
- **Purpose:** Deep-dive into specific time interval coverage
- **Content:**
  - Aggregated metrics: Total agents scheduled, forecasted demand, coverage %, risk level
  - **Top agents by availability** in that slot (expandable list)
  - Skills breakdown for scheduled agents
  - "View affected agents in calendar" button → filters calendar to show agents working that interval

**3. Smart Scheduling Search Modal**
- **Trigger:** "Find Best Time" button or "Add Meeting" → "Use Smart Search"
- **Purpose:** IOI-driven slot recommendation workflow **with dynamic agent selection**
- **Content:**
  - **Step 1 (Input):** Meeting title, duration, date range, priority
    - **Agent selection mode:** "Let system recommend" OR "Manually select agents" OR "Skill requirements" (e.g., "5 agents with Spanish + Technical skills")
  - **Step 2 (Results):** Top 5 ranked slots with IOI scores
    - **For each slot:** Shows which agents system proposes (based on availability, fairness, compliance)
    - Preview: "Slot 1 (IOI 92): Sarah, Mike, Lisa, John, Emma" with mini-avatars
  - **Step 3 (Break Adjustment):** If needed, show proposed break moves for recommended agents
  - **Step 4 (Confirmation):** "Meeting booked. Calendar filtered to show 5 affected agents."

**4. Calendar Week View (Contextual/Filtered)**
- **Layout:** Time-of-day rows (7am-7pm, 15-min intervals) x **Selected agents (configurable subset)** OR **Aggregated coverage summary row**
- **Purpose:** Manage and visualize **filtered or relevant agent schedules** for the selected context (not all agents simultaneously)
- **View Modes:**
  - **Summary Mode (Default):** Single row showing team coverage % by interval (heatmap-style bar chart)
  - **Filtered Group Mode:** Show 5-20 agents based on current filter (skill, team, IOI recommendation)
  - **Individual Schedule Mode:** Drill down to specific agents on demand (click agent → expand their full schedule)
- **Interactions:**
  - Drag-and-drop activities within visible subset
  - Click-to-add (auto-suggests agent subset via IOI if needed)
  - Hover for details
  - Multi-select agents from filtered list (not all 100)
  - **Pagination/virtual scrolling** if filtered subset exceeds 20 agents (performance optimization)

**5. Agent Notification Preview Panel**
- **Trigger:** Click "View Agent Impact" or dedicated "Notifications" tab
- **Purpose:** Demonstrate human-centered communication design
- **Content:** 3-4 example notification cards showing different scenarios (meeting added, break adjusted, training scheduled)
- **Context:** Notifications reference agents from recently viewed filtered subset (not abstract "all agents")

**6. Audit Trail View**
- **Layout:** Full-width table below or beside calendar (toggleable)
- **Purpose:** Event log for accountability and decision traceability
- **Features:** Sortable columns, filters (date range, user, action type, affected agents), CSV export button
- **Context Note:** Audit trail reflects actions on **filtered subsets of agents** rather than global schedule modifications

**7. About/Help Modal**
- **Trigger:** Info icon or "About" link in footer
- **Purpose:** Explain demo scope, feature highlights, version info
- **Content:** Brief overview, feature list, version/build timestamp, credits

## Optional Forward-Thinking Enhancements (Not MVP, Note for Future)

**Mini Heatmaps per Agent:**
Tiny sparkline-style tiles showing each agent's workload distribution across the week; clicking expands to their full schedule.

**Cluster View:**
Summarize agents by skill group, region, or team; expand one cluster at a time. Example: "Technical Support (25 agents) | Spanish Bilingual (18 agents) | Team Leads (8 agents)" → click to drill down.

**"Smart Focus" Button:**
When the system recommends a slot during Smart Search, auto-filter the calendar to **only affected agents** with highlight/focus animation.

**Agent Comparison View:**
Side-by-side view of 2-4 agents for comparing availability, recent activity history, IOI fairness scores.

## Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA

**Color Contrast:**
- All text meets 4.5:1 contrast ratio (3:1 for large text >18pt)
- Heatmap colors (red/yellow/green) supplemented with patterns or icons for colorblind users
- Focus indicators visible on all interactive elements (2px outline, high contrast)

**Keyboard Navigation (Simplified for Filtered Views):**
- Full tab-order support: Calendar grid (visible subset only) → Agent panel → Modals → Buttons
- **Navigation scope:** Keyboard nav operates within **visible filtered subset** only (not all 100 agents)—improves performance and usability
- Arrow keys navigate visible calendar cells, Enter/Space to select
- **Pagination controls:** Tab to "Next 20 agents" / "Previous 20 agents" buttons if subset exceeds one page
- Esc key closes modals and cancels workflows
- Skip links to bypass repetitive navigation (e.g., "Skip to calendar")

**Screen Reader Support:**
- ARIA labels on heatmap cells: "Tuesday 2:00 PM, Coverage 92%, Green zone, Safe"
- Live regions announce dynamic updates: "Meeting added to Tuesday 2 PM for 8 agents, Coverage updated to 98%"
- **Filter state announcements:** "Showing 10 agents: Technical skill group"
- Form inputs properly labeled, error messages associated with fields

**Practical Scope for Demo:**
Focus accessibility efforts on **high-impact, low-effort wins** appropriate for a demo:
- Color contrast (automatic via Shadcn/Tailwind)
- Keyboard navigation within filtered subsets (built into React components, no 100-row grid complexity)
- Basic ARIA labels (semantic HTML + strategic aria-label additions)
- Skip full screen reader optimization for complex grid interactions (note as future enhancement)

## Branding

**Design Language:**
Modern, data-centric enterprise SaaS aesthetic inspired by:
- **Notion:** Clean, minimal, generous white space, subtle shadows
- **Linear:** Crisp typography, muted color palette, smooth animations
- **Tableau:** Professional data visualization, clear hierarchies, trust-building precision

**Color Palette:**
- **Primary:** Slate/blue-gray (neutral, professional)
- **Accent:** Teal/cyan (intelligent, tech-forward) for CTAs and highlights
- **Semantic:**
  - Green: Safe/success (high coverage, compliant, positive IOI)
  - Yellow: Caution (tight coverage, needs attention)
  - Red: Risk/error (low coverage, violations, conflicts)
  - Blue: Informational (standard shifts)
  - Purple: Important (lunch breaks)
  - Orange: Moderate (short breaks)

**Typography:**
- **Headings:** Inter or Geist (clean, modern sans-serif)
- **Body:** System font stack for performance (SF Pro, Segoe UI, Roboto)
- **Data/Scores:** Tabular figures (monospace numbers) for alignment in tables

**Iconography:**
- **Primary:** Lucide icons (open-source, consistent style, optimized SVGs) for UI controls
- **Activity types:** SVG icons styled to match Lucide aesthetic (avoid emojis for enterprise professional feel)
  - Alternative: Use emojis (🍽️☕👥📚💬📊) if user testing shows they improve quick recognition without undermining professionalism—design decision deferred to UX Architect

**Visual Effects:**
- Subtle shadows for depth (cards, modals, dropdowns)
- Smooth transitions (150-200ms) on hover, click, drag
- **Focus animations:** When Smart Search recommends agents, subtle highlight/pulse on affected calendar rows
- No flashy animations—professional restraint
- Loading states: Skeleton screens (not spinners) to maintain visual structure

## Target Platforms: Web Responsive

**Primary Target:** Desktop browsers (1920x1080 and 1440x900 most common)
- Optimized for laptop/monitor demo scenarios
- Full feature set accessible

**Secondary Target:** Tablet landscape (iPad 10.2", 1080p tablets)
- Calendar grid adapts to narrower viewport (fewer agents visible by default, horizontal scroll for filtered subsets)
- Heatmap remains interactive, modals adjust to screen size
- Touch-friendly targets (44px minimum tap areas)

**Out of Scope:** Mobile phone optimization
- Not designed for <768px width
- Graceful degradation: Show "Best viewed on tablet or desktop" message on small screens

**Browser Support:**
- Chrome 120+ (primary testing)
- Firefox 121+ (secondary testing)
- Safari 17+ (macOS/iOS testing)
- Edge 120+ (graceful degradation, not optimized)
