# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

You are about to receive the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the **Intelligent WFM Scheduling Demo** - a proof-of-concept showcasing CvD-integrated intelligent scheduling with IOI scoring.

**Your Task:**
Create a comprehensive UX/Design architecture document that translates the PRD's UI Design Goals section into detailed design specifications, component libraries, interaction patterns, and visual design guidelines.

**Key Focus Areas:**
1. **Design System:** Expand on Tailwind + Shadcn/ui implementation with color palette, typography scale, spacing system, and component variants
2. **Interaction Patterns:** Detail the "intelligent focus" paradigm - filtered views, Smart Search wizard flow, drag-and-drop behaviors
3. **Heatmap Visualization:** Design the CvD heatmap color-coding, tooltip interactions, detail modal layout
4. **Calendar Interface:** Specify Outlook-style calendar grid, activity blocks, view mode switcher, agent panel
5. **Accessibility Implementation:** Provide WCAG 2.1 AA compliance strategy - keyboard navigation maps, ARIA label patterns, color contrast specifications
6. **Responsive Layouts:** Define breakpoints and layout adaptations for desktop (1920x1080), laptop (1440x900), tablet (1024x768)

**Deliverable:**
A UX/Design Architecture document that the development team can use to implement consistent, accessible, professional UI components.

**Input:** [docs/prd.md](docs/prd.md) - Full PRD with Requirements, UI Design Goals, Technical Assumptions, and Epic/Story definitions

## Architect Prompt

You are about to receive the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the **Intelligent WFM Scheduling Demo** - a client-side React application demonstrating intelligent WFM scheduling concepts.

**Your Task:**
Create a comprehensive technical architecture document covering component structure, data models, state management, algorithm implementations, and deployment configuration.

**Key Focus Areas:**
1. **Component Architecture:** React component hierarchy, folder structure, separation of concerns (UI vs. logic)
2. **Data Models:** TypeScript interfaces for Agent, Activity, CvDDataPoint, IOIResult, AuditLogEntry
3. **State Management:** Zustand store design or Context API structure, data flow patterns
4. **Core Algorithms:** IOI scoring logic, break adjustment algorithm, coverage calculation, conflict detection
5. **Technology Stack Validation:** Confirm React Big Calendar vs. FullCalendar, Recharts vs. custom heatmap, Zustand vs. Context API
6. **Performance Strategy:** Memoization patterns, virtual scrolling implementation, lazy loading approach
7. **Build & Deployment:** Vite configuration, Vercel deployment settings, environment structure

**Deliverable:**
A Technical Architecture document that enables the development team to build the application following best practices, meeting all performance benchmarks (< 2s load, < 200ms interactions, < 500ms IOI calculation).

**Input:** [docs/prd.md](docs/prd.md) - Full PRD with Requirements, Technical Assumptions, Epic/Story definitions, and validated checklist results

**Special Note:** This is a demo/proof-of-concept with explicit scope limitations (no backend, no auth, no persistence). Architecture should prioritize demo polish and visual impact over production scalability.
