# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Demonstrate intelligent scheduling concepts (IOI scoring, CvD awareness, break optimization) in a visually impressive, interactive demo
- Showcase BMAD™ methodology and analysis framework capabilities through high-quality product thinking
- Create a portfolio-ready proof-of-concept that runs on any modern browser without backend infrastructure
- Deliver a professional, slick UI that feels like enterprise software, not a prototype
- Prove technical feasibility of CvD-integrated intelligent scheduling with explainable AI scoring
- Enable 5-10 minute demo flow showcasing all six core features interactively

## Background Context

Contact center WFM planners currently spend 30-45 minutes manually finding meeting slots for 10 agents, with no visibility into service level impact. Existing enterprise WFM platforms (NICE, Verint, Calabrio) have Capacity vs Demand data buried in reports rather than integrated into scheduling workflows, and offer no AI-driven slot recommendations or intelligent break optimization.

This demo addresses a validated feature gap in the market: no competitor offers CvD-integrated intelligent scheduling with explainable IOI scoring. By building a client-side React demo with realistic contact center data, we can prove the concept is technically feasible and visually compelling—establishing differentiation for potential future product development or partnership opportunities (e.g., Five9 integration as referenced in supplemental docs).
