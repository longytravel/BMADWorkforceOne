# Story 1.5: Create Basic App Shell

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Foundation & Demo Infrastructure
**Story Points:** 3
**Priority:** P0 - Critical

## Status

Ready for Review

---

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to see a professional app shell with header, navigation, and layout structure,
**so that** the application has a polished appearance and consistent layout from the start.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** I open the application, **When** the page loads, **Then** I should see a professional header with app title and navigation
2. **Given** the app is loading data, **When** initialization is in progress, **Then** I should see a loading screen with skeleton UI or spinner
3. **Given** an error occurs during initialization, **When** data fails to load, **Then** I should see a friendly error screen with retry option
4. **Given** the app is running, **When** a React component throws an error, **Then** I should see an Error Boundary screen instead of a white screen
5. **Given** the app shell is rendered, **When** I inspect the layout, **Then** it should be responsive and work on desktop (1920x1080) and tablet (1024x768) viewports
6. **Given** the app uses proper semantic HTML, **When** I audit accessibility, **Then** the header should use `<header>`, main content `<main>`, and have skip links

## Dev Notes

### Component Structure

**AppShell.tsx:**
```typescript
interface AppShellProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export function AppShell({ children }: AppShellProps) {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col">
      <Header />
      <main id="main-content" className="flex-1 container mx-auto px-4 py-6">
        {children}
      </main>
      <footer className="bg-slate-100 py-4 text-center text-sm text-slate-600">
        v2.0, Built Oct 2025
      </footer>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**ErrorBoundary.tsx:**
```typescript
interface ErrorBoundaryState {
  hasError: boolean;
  error?: Error;
}

export class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component<
  { children: React.ReactNode },
  ErrorBoundaryState
> {
  // Implement getDerivedStateFromError, componentDidCatch, render
}
```

**App.tsx Flow:**
```typescript
function App() {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Load demo data (Story 1.4 JSON files)
    // Set isLoading = false on success
    // Set error on failure
  }, []);

  if (isLoading) return <LoadingScreen />;
  if (error) return <ErrorScreen error={error} onRetry={handleRetry} />;

  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <AppShell>
        <Dashboard />
      </AppShell>
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```

### Design System (from PRD UI Design Goals)

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Slate/blue-gray (#64748b)
- Accent: Teal/cyan (#14B8A6) for CTAs
- Background: White (#FFFFFF) with subtle gray (#F8FAFC)

**Typography:**
- Headings: Inter or Geist (use Tailwind system fonts)
- Body: System font stack (SF Pro, Segoe UI, Roboto)

**Spacing:**
- Consistent use of Tailwind spacing scale (px-4, py-6, gap-4, etc.)

### Accessibility Requirements (NFR11: WCAG 2.1 AA)

- **Skip Links:** "Skip to main content" link at top
- **Semantic HTML:** `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` elements
- **Focus Indicators:** Visible 2px outline on all interactive elements
- **ARIA Labels:** Loading screen uses aria-live="polite"
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Tab order flows logically (header → main content)

### Architecture References

**From Architecture Document (Section: Frontend Architecture - Component Architecture):**
- Layout components in `src/components/Layout/`
- ErrorBoundary pattern documented
- Loading states and error handling required (FR21, FR22)

**From PRD (Section: UI Design Goals):**
- Professional enterprise WFM tool aesthetic
- Notion/Linear-inspired clean design
- Generous white space, subtle shadows

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
- No unit tests required for basic layout components
- Manual verification: Loading screen displays correctly
- Manual verification: Error boundary catches errors
- Manual verification: Responsive layout works on desktop and tablet

**Test Validation:**
- Load app - see loading screen briefly
- App loads successfully - see header with title
- Simulate error (delete JSON file) - see error screen with retry
- Throw error in component - error boundary catches it
- Test on mobile viewport (responsive)
- Tab through UI - skip link works
