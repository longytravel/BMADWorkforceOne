# Intelligent WFM Scheduling Demo

> Interactive demo showcasing CvD-integrated intelligent scheduling with explainable IOI scoring

[Live Demo](https://wfm-intelligence-demo.vercel.app) | [Documentation](docs/)

## Overview

Contact center WFM planners spend 30-45 minutes manually finding meeting slots for 10 agents. This demo proves the technical feasibility of CvD-integrated intelligent scheduling with explainable AI scoring.

**Key Features:**
- ðŸ”¥ **CvD Heatmap** - Real-time capacity vs demand visualization
- ðŸ§  **IOI Scoring** - Intelligent Opportunity Index (4-factor algorithm)
- ðŸ“… **Smart Calendar** - Drag-and-drop scheduling with conflict detection
- âš¡ **Break Optimization** - Compliance-aware break adjustment proposals
- ðŸ“Š **Audit Trail** - Full transparency and decision traceability
- ðŸŽ¯ **Demo Mode** - Reset button for repeatable presentations
