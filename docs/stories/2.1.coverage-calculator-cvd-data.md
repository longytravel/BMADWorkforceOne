# Story 2.1: Coverage Calculator & CvD Data Structure

**Epic:** Epic 2 - CvD Heatmap & Coverage Intelligence
**Story Points:** 5
**Priority:** P1 - High

---

## Status

Ready for Review

---

## Story

**As a** WFM planner,
**I want** the system to calculate real-time coverage percentages by comparing scheduled agents against forecasted demand,
**so that** I can visualize capacity vs demand and identify service level risks across the week.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** demo data is loaded, **When** the coverage calculator runs, **Then** it should generate CvDDataPoint records for all 672 intervals (7 days × 96 fifteen-minute intervals)
2. **Given** a 15-minute interval with forecasted demand, **When** agents are scheduled during that time, **Then** coverage percentage should be calculated as (scheduledAgents / forecastedCalls) × 100
3. **Given** a 15-minute interval has zero forecasted demand, **When** coverage is calculated, **Then** it should return 100% coverage (no demand to cover) and risk level 'safe'
4. **Given** coverage percentage is calculated, **When** coverage is < 90%, **Then** risk level should be 'risk' (red)
5. **Given** coverage percentage is calculated, **When** coverage is 90-105%, **Then** risk level should be 'caution' (yellow)
6. **Given** coverage percentage is calculated, **When** coverage is > 105%, **Then** risk level should be 'safe' (green)
7. **Given** an agent's schedule changes (activity added/removed), **When** recalculation is triggered, **Then** all affected time intervals should update their coverage and risk level
8. **Given** coverage calculation completes, **When** viewing the data structure, **Then** each CvDDataPoint should include intervalStart, dayOfWeek, timeSlot, forecastedCalls, scheduledAgents, coveragePercent, and riskLevel
9. **Given** the calculator runs on demo data, **When** validated, **Then** calculations should complete within 500ms for 672 intervals

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story implements the **foundational data layer** for Epic 2's CvD Heatmap feature. The coverage calculator is a pure function-based system that computes capacity vs demand metrics in real-time as schedules change.

### Data Models (Source: architecture/data-models.md)

**CvDDataPoint Interface:**
```typescript
type RiskLevel = 'safe' | 'caution' | 'risk';

interface CvDDataPoint {
  intervalStart: string; // "2025-10-20T14:00:00Z" (ISO 8601)
  dayOfWeek: string;     // "Monday"
  timeSlot: string;      // "14:00" (display format)
  forecastedCalls: number;
  scheduledAgents: number; // Computed real-time
  coveragePercent: number; // (scheduledAgents / forecastedCalls) * 100
  riskLevel: RiskLevel;    // 'safe' >105%, 'caution' 90-105%, 'risk' <90%
  metadata: {
    skillsAvailable: string[]; // Skills of scheduled agents
    peakHour: boolean;         // Flag for 10am-12pm, 2pm-4pm peaks
  };
}
```

**Activity Interface** (used for agent schedules):
```typescript
interface Activity {
  id: string;
  agentId: string;
  type: ActivityType;
  startDateTime: string; // ISO 8601
  endDateTime: string;
  durationMinutes: number;
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Source Tree (Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md)

**File Locations:**
- Logic: `src/logic/coverageCalculator.ts` (pure functions)
- Tests: `src/logic/coverageCalculator.test.ts`
- Types: `src/types/index.ts` (CvDDataPoint interface)
- Schemas: `src/types/schemas.ts` (Zod validation)
- Store Integration: `src/stores/appStore.ts` (recalculateCvD action)

**Demo Data:**
- Input: `public/demo-data/cvd-forecast.json` (672 intervals with forecastedCalls)
- Input: `public/demo-data/schedules.json` (agent activities)

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#src/logic, #public/demo-data]

### Coding Standards (Source: architecture/coding-standards.md)

- **Pure Functions for Logic:** All business logic must be pure functions with no side effects
- **Type Safety First:** All functions must have explicit TypeScript types (no `any`)
- **Data Validation:** All JSON data must be validated with Zod schemas on load
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Functions: camelCase (e.g., `calculateCoverageForInterval()`)
  - Types/Interfaces: PascalCase (e.g., `CvDDataPoint`)
  - Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `RISK_THRESHOLD_LOW = 90`)

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Pure Functions for Logic, #Type Safety First]

### Tech Stack (Source: architecture/tech-stack.md)

- **TypeScript:** 5.3+ (strict mode enabled)
- **State Management:** Zustand 4.5+ (with Immer middleware for immutability)
- **Data Validation:** Zod 3.22+ (validate JSON structure on load)
- **Date/Time Library:** date-fns 3.0+ (for time interval calculations)
- **Testing:** Vitest 1.2+ (unit tests for algorithms)

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]

### State Management Integration (Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md)

**Zustand Store Actions:**
```typescript
interface AppState {
  cvdData: CvDDataPoint[];

  // Action to recalculate coverage
  recalculateCvD: () => void;
}

// Implementation pattern:
recalculateCvD: () => set((state) => {
  const calculator = new CoverageCalculator();
  state.cvdData = calculator.recalculateAll(
    state.agents,
    state.activities,
    state.cvdData
  );
})
```

**Auto-triggering:** The `addActivity`, `updateActivity`, and `deleteActivity` actions should automatically call `recalculateCvD()` to keep coverage data in sync.

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#State Management Architecture]

### Algorithm Design

**Coverage Calculation Formula:**
```
coveragePercent = forecastedCalls === 0
  ? 100  // No demand to cover
  : (scheduledAgents / forecastedCalls) × 100

where:
- scheduledAgents = count of agents with activities overlapping the interval
- forecastedCalls = demand forecast from cvd-forecast.json
- Zero demand edge case: Returns 100% coverage (no calls to handle = perfect coverage)
```

**Risk Level Thresholds:**
- `riskLevel = 'risk'` when coveragePercent < 90%
- `riskLevel = 'caution'` when 90% ≤ coveragePercent ≤ 105%
- `riskLevel = 'safe'` when coveragePercent > 105%

**Interval Generation:**
- Start: Monday 00:00
- End: Sunday 23:45
- Step: 15 minutes
- Total: 7 days × 24 hours × 4 intervals/hour = 672 intervals

### Performance Considerations

- Target: < 500ms for 672 interval calculations
- Optimization: Only recalculate affected intervals when activities change (not full 672)
- Use `useMemo()` in React components to prevent unnecessary recalculations

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.4 (Generate Demo Data):
- Demo data structure is already validated and loaded
- cvd-forecast.json contains 672 pre-generated intervals
- schedules.json contains agent activities with ISO 8601 datetime strings

### Test Framework
- **Tool:** Vitest 1.2+ (Vite-native, Jest-compatible API)
- **Location:** `src/logic/coverageCalculator.test.ts`
- **Coverage Target:** 80%+ for `/logic` folder

### Unit Test Cases

**Coverage Calculation Tests:**
```typescript
describe('Coverage Calculator', () => {
  it('should calculate 100% coverage when agents equal demand', () => {
    const result = calculateCoverageForInterval(
      10, // forecastedCalls
      10  // scheduledAgents
    );
    expect(result.coveragePercent).toBe(100);
  });

  it('should calculate 120% coverage when agents exceed demand', () => {
    const result = calculateCoverageForInterval(10, 12);
    expect(result.coveragePercent).toBe(120);
  });

  it('should calculate 80% coverage when agents below demand', () => {
    const result = calculateCoverageForInterval(10, 8);
    expect(result.coveragePercent).toBe(80);
  });

  it('should return 100% coverage when forecasted demand is zero', () => {
    const result = calculateCoverageForInterval(0, 5);
    expect(result.coveragePercent).toBe(100);
    expect(result.riskLevel).toBe('safe');
  });
});
```

**Risk Level Tests:**
```typescript
describe('Risk Level Classification', () => {
  it('should return "risk" for coverage < 90%', () => {
    expect(determineRiskLevel(89)).toBe('risk');
  });

  it('should return "caution" for coverage 90-105%', () => {
    expect(determineRiskLevel(90)).toBe('caution');
    expect(determineRiskLevel(105)).toBe('caution');
  });

  it('should return "safe" for coverage > 105%', () => {
    expect(determineRiskLevel(106)).toBe('safe');
  });
});
```

**Performance Test:**
```typescript
it('should calculate 672 intervals in < 500ms', () => {
  const start = performance.now();
  const calculator = new CoverageCalculator();
  calculator.recalculateAll(agents, activities, cvdData);
  const duration = performance.now() - start;

  expect(duration).toBeLessThan(500);
});
```
